    "text = \"\"\"South Korea\\'s telecommunications regulator, the Korea Communications Commission (KCC), has accused   and   of abusing their dominant position in the app market. The KCC has warned the tech giants of possible fines amounting to $50.5 million. According to the KCC, the two companies have forced app developers into using specific payment methods, causing delays in app review, and creating an unfair environment in the app market. The commission is notifying companies of necessary corrective action and will determine fines. In 2021, South Korea amended the Telecommunication Business Act to ban app store operators from mandating the use of their payment systems by software developers. The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) stated that Google and Apple\\'s enforcement of certain payment methods, and Apple\\'s \"discriminatory charging of fees to domestic app developers,\" are likely to undermine the law\\'s purpose of promoting fair competition. Apple released a statement disagreeing with the conclusions presented by the KCC in their Examiner\\'s Report. They believe that their recent changes to the App Store comply with the Telecommunications Business Act. Apple stated that they will continue to engage with the KCC to share their views, as they have always done in the past. Google told Reuters that what KCC has shared today is a \"pre-notice\", and that they will carefully review it and submit their response. Once the final written decision is shared with them, they will evaluate it and decide on the next course of action. Korean regulators will impose fines of up to 68 million won ($50.47 million) on Google and Apple after hearing from both companies. Google’s history with South Korean regulators Earlier this year, in May, South Korea\\'s Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fined Google $32 million for preventing developers from releasing mobile video games on One Store, a local Korean peer of Google\\'s Play Store.  Google allegedly required Korean video game companies to exclusively release their new games on the Play Store from June 2016 to April 2018, which banned the local game makers from releasing their content on One Store. In 2021, the KFTC fined Google $177 million for abusing its market dominance in the Android operating system market. Google claims that it has contributed to the growth and successful global expansion of Korean mobile game developers that have launched their games on Play over the last decade.

      "###Question: Categorize this given article into one of the given categories: NEW DELHI: India wants Saudi Arabia's Aramco to participate in its planned 6.5 million metric tons (MMT) strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) programme as the South Asian nation wants to strengthen ties with its key oil supplier, according to a document seen by Reuters. The two nations have been talking about Aramco's participation in the SPR programme for years. The talks, however, gained traction after Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month. \"Under Phase II Strategic Petroleum Reserves Programme construction of two new commercial-cum-strategic petroleum reserves of 6.5 MMT have been approved,\" the Indian government said in an internal document, adding that \"Saudi Arabia's Aramco can be invited to participate in the Phase II.\" Aramco declined to comment, while the Saudi government did not respond to emails seeking comment.  India's prime ministers office, oil ministry and finance ministry did not respond either. In 2021, India overhauled its SPR policy allowing commercial sale of the crude to boost private participation in the building of new storage facilities, mirroring a model adopted by countries such as Japan and South Korea. India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, imports over 80% of its oil needs and has built strategic storage at three locations in southern India to store over 5 million tons of oil to protect against supply disruption. Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) has leased 750,000 tons of oil storage in the 1.5 million ton SPR in the southern city of Mangaluru. India has conducted two road shows for the second phase of its SPR programme that received interest from companies including Trafigura, British Petroleum, Petrochina, Hyundai, Gulf Energy, Glencore and Shell, a government statement said. Regarding a potential deal between India and Saudi Aramco, KPMG Partner Anish De commented: \"Getting the investment there will align the economic and political interest. There is good economic and political reasons for the two countries to do it.\" During the visit by the crown prince to India, Saudi Arabia announced plans for an investment facilitation office in India's Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, a tax-neutral financial service centre.  India is also scouting for land to build a 1.2 million metric tonnes per year refinery and petrochemical project in western India with participation of Saudi Aramco and ADNOC. The two governments will form a task force to remove hurdles like land acquisition, which has delayed the project, which was conceived in 2018. Saudi Arabia has committed $50 billion investment for the project.\n",

      "###Question: Categorize this given article into one of the given categories: A group of banks that have been in talks to lend about $250 million each toward a syndicated loan of about $3.5 billion to refinance debt which the Adani Group took out to fund its purchase of Ambuja Cements Ltd. have received internal approval for the deal, according to people familiar with the matter.The three banks are Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG and Standard Chartered Plc, said the people, asking not to be identified when discussing a private matter. They’re part of a larger consortium in talks for the syndicated loan to billionaire Gautam Adani’s conglomerate. Some institutions were in discussions to lend $400 million each, in what could become one of the biggest loan deals in Asia this year, Bloomberg reported last month citing people familiar with the matter. No new information was given on the status of that group of banks. The prospective deal adds to evidence that the group, with business interests stretching from ports to green energy, is closing the chapter on the allegations of malfeasance made by US shortseller Hindenburg Research earlier this year. The claims — repeatedly denied by Adani officials — caused a selloff in the stocks and bonds of group firms. Negotiations with global banks on debt refinancing stalled as some banks balked, Bloomberg reported in February. Spokespeople at Barclays, Deutsche and Standard Chartered all declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg on Tuesday. A representative for Adani Group did not offer any immediate comment.Adani bought the India assets of Switzerland’s Holcim Ltd. in 2022, as the conglomerate looked to move beyond its core business of operating ports, power plants and coal mines and into areas like data centers, airports, digital services, retail and media. The transaction has not yet been finalized and the terms could still change.\n",

      "###Question: Categorize this given article into one of the given categories: MUMBAI: Dalal Street discounted possible repercussions of the conflict in West Asia as strong buying by domestic players gave the sensex a 567-point push to close at 66,079 on Tuesday. Although foreign investors remained net sellers, the sensex's gain during the day, most of which came in the later half of the session, was attributed to short-covering by speculators. Fall in crude oil prices also helped investor sentiment, market players said.Stocks from across sectors contributed to the day's gain in the sensex with ICICI Bank, Infosys and HDFC Bank contributing the most.Foreign investors were net sellers at a little over Rs 1,000 crore while domestic institutions were net buyers at Rs 1,963 crore, BSE data showed.Brokers and dealers expect the sensex to build on Tuesday's gains on Wednesday, as falling US treasury bill yields are expected to boost investor sentiment further. The rupee ended nearly unchanged at 83.26 to the dollar - compared to Monday's 83.27. And in the government bond market, the benchmark 10-year yield marginally softened to close at 7.35% from 7.38% the previous day.\n",

      "###Question: Categorize this given article into one of the given categories: A 10,000 square feet apartment at The Camellias by DLF in Gurgaon's Golf Course Road has recently clinched a staggering Rs 100 crore deal, according to an ET report. A similar-sized apartment was being sold for Rs 60 crore just a few months ago, signaling a significant surge in per-square-foot rates for this exclusive address.The surge in luxury real estate prices has elevated Gurgaon and Delhi’s upscale areas to the level of Mumbai's prestigious neighborhoods, with per-square-foot prices now surpassing Rs 1 lakh. Property experts are drawing parallels between The Camellias and Delhi's esteemed Lutyens zone, home to the country's top business magnates and political elite.Amit Goyal, managing director of India Sotheby’s International Realty told ET that DLF Golf Links sees substantial demand for apartments from senior executives at MNCs, startup founders and businessmen due to its exceptional amenities and ecosystem. The Aralias, the Magnolias, and the Camellias, the three Golf Links projects, have all experienced significant price increases in the past year. DLF sells 10,000-sq ft units in bare-shell condition for Rs 85 crore. However, owners who have made interior improvements are now seeking over Rs 100 crore for apartments of the same size, making it one of the country's most expensive condominiums.Around 15% of property owners at The Camellias have upgraded from 'The Magnolias' and 'The Aralias’. A majority of buyers hail from the Delhi NCR region. Notable property owners at The Camellias include Aman Gupta, founder of BoAt; JC Chaudhry, founder of Aakash Educational Services; and the Elan Group, a real estate firm. Many startup founders have also invested in apartments in this sought-after property.At 260kmph, supercars on Delhi-Mumbai Expressway are flouting driving normsAccording to property experts, after the pandemic ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNI) look to put their money in gated condominiums instead of standalone bungalows since they get all the facilities within the premises.The Camellias, which were introduced less than a decade ago at Rs 22,500 per square foot, are currently being sold for over Rs 85,000 per square foot. In simple terms, an apartment purchased for Rs 23 crore in 2014, spanning 10,000 square feet, is now valued at nearly four times its original price, at Rs 85 crore.This trend of high-value apartment transactions is also gaining ground in Delhi, with transactions surpassing Rs 1 lakh per square foot. However, Mumbai's exclusive areas, such as Peddar Road, Malabar Hill, Marine Drive, the Oval Maidan, Worli, and Cuffe Parade, still maintain their lead over Delhi.\n",

Read AlsoNo GST cut seen on cement, Li-ion cellsThe GST Council is set to discuss the appointment of members to proposed tribunals during their meeting on Saturday. However, there are no expected changes to levies on cement, health insurance premiums for seniors, and lithium-ion batteries. Lower rates for millet mix are being considered toGST Council decides to cut tax on molasses to 5%The GST Council on Saturday decided to reduce GST on molasses to 5 per cent, from 18 per cent, and exempt alcohol for human consumption from the levy. Chhattisgarh Deputy Chief Minister T S Singh Deo, who is a member of the GST Council, said extra neutral alcohol (ENA) for industrial use willAmong the other changes, the council decided to lower the tax on molasses from 28% to 5%, arguing that it will leave more money with sugar mills to clear the dues of sugarcane farmers and also provide a boost to cattle feed production, for which it is a key ingredient. A section of the alcohol industry, too, uses molasses to make extra neutral alcohol (ENA).For the alcohol industry, the bigger relief came as the council decided not to exercise its power to tax ENA and ceded it to the states, which will decide whether they want to impose tax or not. The clarification came after the Allahabad high court ruled that after GST kicked in, states did not have the power to levy tax on ENA. The Centre also got the same legal opinion, resulting in the decision to cede the power to the state government, Sitharaman said. \n",

      "###Question: Categorize this given article into one of the given categories: CHENNAI: Customs officials at Bengaluru airport found a dead baby kangaroo in the luggage of a passenger who had come from Bangkok on Monday night.Deputy Director of Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), southern region M Kirupasankar said the passenger, Sadam Hussain from Chennai, also had a green iguana, an Aldabra tortoise, a Vietnamese black-breasted leaf turtle, and 75 Asian leaf turtles in his checked-in baggage.A senior wildlife official from Tamil Nadu said the seizure raised suspicion that smugglers had shifted operations to Bengaluru following increased vigil in Chennai. However, another senior official said one incident did not signal a shift.On Sunday night, customs officials at Chennai airport seized a Burmese python, a ball python, and half a dozen baby iguanas. Both python species are in great demand in the illegal pet trade. The Customs officials sent the consignment back to its place of origin.Conservationists complain that the illegal pet trade is flourishing because smugglers go off scot-free. The Union government made amendments to the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, recently to include some of the species that are covered under the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species (CITES). Despite that the wildlife trade is thriving, they say.With increased checks at airports across the country, the smugglers are transporting exotic pets by road. Recently, a large number of star tortoises were seized from a person, when he attempted to smuggle them out of the country through the Myanmar border.\n",

      "###Question: Categorize this given article into one of the given categories: VIJAYAWADA: Remember Jaguar Kumar of Ukraine with his big cats - a rare amour leopard and a black panther? He has now adopted two lion cubs as his pets after leaving the war-torn country. Dr Giri Kumar Patil, popularly known as Jaguar Kumar because of his pet big cats, was forced to leave them with an animal rescue organisation in Russia. However, his love for wild cats continues, and he has now adopted two lion cubs, a male and a female aged 2.5 months from an animal rescue organisation. The cubs were rescued from the war-torn eastern part of Ukraine a few days ago. The 42-year-old doctor hails from Tanuku in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh and moved to Ukraine in 2007 to study medicine. Since 2014, he was working at a hospital in Severodonetsk as a practicising orthopaedic. The hospital shut down after the war began. In 2020, Kumar adopted a male amour leopard, which is a rare hybrid of a leopard and a Jaguar. Just before the war broke, he adopted a black panther. Kumar said the lion cubs were noticed near Donbas in Ukraine by an animal rescue organisation, and he adopted them on October 6. \"As I have an international licence to adopt wild animals and also run a wildlife rescue organisation, it was a hassle-free process with the paperwork. As per rules, I can raise the cubs for only a year. Later, they would be sent to pride in South Africa,\" he told STOI.Kumar left his wild cats with a rescue organisation in Ukraine as he couldn't move his pets to his new place, Lviv near the Ukraine-Hungary border from the war-torn region in Eastern Ukraine where he lived. Dr Kumar was forced to leave his cats in Ukraine He said while the rescue organisation was shifting the wild cats to their rescue home in Russia, a local 'occupied' mayor and police personnel stopped the vehicle and demanded to leave the wild cats with them.\"They told the rescue team that they would eat the wild cats and sell their skin for money. After two days of discussions and submission of documents to the higher authorities, the animals were allowed to move to the rescue home. I made the agreement with the rescue home that I can bring them back to my place after the war ends and financial issues are sorted out,\" Kumar said.In April, Kumar was forced to leave his pet wild cats in war-torn Ukraine and shift to Poland in search of a job after his funds dried up. As the situation became worse, the animals' caretaker threatened to abandon them in Kumar's house and move to a safe place along with his family. However, he stayed back after Kumar promised to double his salary. Kumar was also held hostage by the Russian army twice - in April and September 2022 - on suspicions of being a spy. He was set free after the Ukraine army confirmed that he was not a spy but a doctor.\n",

People like him have a reason to rejoice a pet park is on the anvil in Abiramapuram.The Mylapore MLA, Dha Velu, is planning to convert a portion of the Greater Chennai Corporation Park in Demonte Colony in Abiramapuram into a pet park. While pet lovers welcome the move, they want the facility to be maintained well and want the pet parents to exercise caution while bringing aggressive pets.\"Now, pets are not allowed in parks. Taking them out within apartment complexes is not encouraged. Hence, I thought a pet park would be of help. I have submitted the proposal to Greater Chennai Corporation and to the chief minister's special projects wing,\" said MLA Velu.He said that walkers won't be disturbed. \"The facility will be created in the middle of the park. It will have a play area for pets, grooming space, fountain, restrooms etc. A pet consultant firm will operate and maintain it. They will rope in experts to give dogs exercises,\" he said.The park will be set up under the Namakku Naame scheme. \"We will hold workshops to promote responsible pet ownership and strengthen community bonds among pet owners,\" he said.Bharat Varadarajan said it was a welcome move. \"Traffic and rash driving have made it impossible to take dogs out for a walk. Besides, the pet eats the food littered on the road and falls sick,\" he explained.Shruti Vinodhraj, member, Tamilnadu Animal Welfare Board, said \"This is a step towards inclusivity. It will be a first for Chennai. There are many like this abroad. However, the operators should allow vaccinated pets and pet parents should muzzle aggressive pets,\" she said.Arun Prasanna G, the founder of the People For Cattle in India (PFCI), said the pet park should have enough shade. \"Some pets put on weight after being in a restricted environment. Exercise facilities for pets in parks will help them stay agile. Ideally, there should be one pet park in each constituency,\" he said. \n",

      "###Question: Categorize this given article into one of the given categories: PUNE: Veterinarians are noticing a rise in tick fever cases in pets amid temperature variations during the monsoon, as the rains are a conducive environment for ticks.Symptoms include fever, loss of appetite, lethargy, coughing, vomiting or loose motions. The condition can be deceptive sometimes as there may be no visible signs for one to three weeks.Anjali Dave, veterinarian from NIBM-Undri Road, said, “It is important identify the parasite before treatment. Sometimes pets show very mild symptoms or underlying issues, which mask symptoms until its chronic.”Weather change also lowers immunity in pets, making them more susceptible to infections. “It is vital for pet parents to take preventive action like drying their pet’s coat,” veterinarian Priti Thorat, said.The monsoon season also means that the anti-tick and flea products are in high demand. Pradip Kumar, owner of a pet supplies store, said, “During rains, many switch from buying regular pet shampoos and conditioners to anti-tick varieties.”Infections like amoebiasis (amoebic dysentery) and leptospirosis (bacterial infection) are also on the rise. Shvesh Bandivadekar, veterinarian from Kothrud, said, “About 50% of the cases that I have consulted on are of infections. We are advising pet parents to give boiled and cooled tap water to pets.”\n",
