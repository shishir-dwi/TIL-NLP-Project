       "\"Spotify has introduced a new feature for its Premium subscribers who love listening to audiobooks. Starting today, users in the UK and Australia can access over 150,000 audiobooks without additional cost, which will be available for subscribers in the US later this year. While users can choose to listen to as many audiobooks as they want out of the vast collection of more than 150,000 titles, they will be limited to 15 hours of free listening time. If users wish to listen more, they will need to purchase additional hours at a rate of 10 hours for $11. As of now, this is exclusively available to individual Premium subscribers and Family or Duo accounts' plan managers. However, Spotify plans to expand its availability in the future. Those not subscribed to Premium or the ones who are subscribed can still purchase any title they want from Spotify's audiobook library without having to pay for additional hours if they have specific books in mind.  “Audiobooks today have one big dominating player. And just like in music and podcasting, we believe that many more consumers want to consume audiobooks and want to listen to audiobooks,” said Spotify founder and CEO Daniel Ek, speaking at the event hosted in the company's New York offices on Tuesday. “And just like in music and podcasting, we’re really excited to be able to bring all the amazing tools that we built for creators and consumers alike to enable more discovery of these amazing audiobooks to the entire world.”  There is an auto-bookmarking tool that will save users time from having to repeat pages. Then, users can activate the Spotify Sleep Timer which will allow users to fall asleep while listening to their books without having to rewind when they wake up. And subscribers can download audiobooks for offline listening.
