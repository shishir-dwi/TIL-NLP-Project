However, England\\'s captain, Jos Buttler, is expressing greater concern about the condition of the outfield in Dharamsala, which he believes is suboptimal for World Cup matches.Former England batsman and current Afghanistan head coach, Jonathan Trott, raised questions about the outfield\\'s condition after spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahmannarrowly avoided injury when his knee jammed into the sandy surface.Read AlsoICC World Cup: England look to bounce back against BangladeshDefending champions England suffered a heavy defeat to New Zealand in their World Cup opener, leaving captain Jos Buttler eager for a comeback against Bangladesh. The loss exposed weaknesses in England\\'s bowling attack, as New Zealand\\'s batsmen dominated the matchDespite theInternational Cricket Council (ICC) granting the outfield an \"average\" rating, permitting it to host World Cup matches, concerns regarding player safety while fielding persist.Jos Buttler, addressing reporters on Monday in anticipation of the match against Bangladesh, voiced his reservations about the outfield, stating, \"It\\'s poor in my own opinion. Any time you\\'re talking about being careful diving or sort of being careful when you\\'re fielding, it goes against everything you want to be as a team. So that\\'s obviously not ideal, the way the surface is, the outfield. But we won\\'t use it as an excuse, we\\'ll adapt to it.\"However, Buttler emphasised that the team would not use the outfield conditions as an excuse and would adapt to the situation. England, the defending champions, are looking to recover from their comprehensive nine-wicket loss to New Zealand in the tournament\\'s opening match in Ahmedabad.The concerns over an unsafe outfield compound the challenges faced by a team already worried about the fitness of Ben Stokes, who missed the first match due to a minor hip issue. Buttler acknowledged that players ideally want to give their all in the field without concerns about safety and added, \"You want to put your body on the line and be trying to save every single run or have confidence in the field. So, it\\'s not as good as it could be or should be, but it\\'s going to be the same for both teams, and the wicket looks fantastic.\"ICC World Cup 2023: New Zealand beat England in opening match by 9 wickets, take sweet revenge of loss in 2019 finalRegarding the team\\'s underwhelming start to their title defence, Buttler was candid, saying, \"We know we didn\\'t play as well as we can in the last game and you\\'re always desperate to put that right, both individually and as a team. So, there\\'s plenty of hunger in the group, and we\\'re excited to get back on the field.\"England\\'s match against Afghanistan on October 15 in New Delhi appears to be a more realistic target for Ben Stokes to return to action. Buttler noted that Stokes has been back in the nets and working toward full fitness, but it is unlikely he will be available for the upcoming match against Bangladesh.(With inputs from Reuters)',\n",

It depends on what the surface looks like and how we need to play on that. So, we wait to see till we go there and figure out. Yeah, we have a few options that we can go in with.

       "       \"Canada is one of the most highlighted countries in the world, it is popular among young and aspirational Indians who want to pursue higher education and professional opportunities and is even considered to be one of the safest countries in the world. However, one thing that Canada is not known for, is its automotive industry. Don’t get us wrong, people do drive cars in Canada, however, they are either American, German or even Indian. The lack of a domestic car brand in Canada got us intrigued and here are some interesting bits of information that we discovered related to Canadian cars and why they failed to make a mark.Canada’s first automobile (1867):While Canada may not have its own car brand, it did try as far back as in 1867. More specifically, this was when watchmaker and jeweller, Henry Seth Taylor, developed his own steam buggy. While Taylor’s steam buggy was Canada’s first-ever ‘automobile’ invented in the country, it did not feature any brakes. The watchmaker had reportedly crashed the steam buggy into a creek soon after introducing it to the world.Is Nissan too late taking the AMT route with the Magnite EZ Shift? | TOI AutoCanadian auto industry takes shape (1899):The automotive industry in Canada actually started to take off almost three decades after Taylor’s failed steam buggy concept. It began with the arrival of the Le Roy Manufacturing Company in 1899. Brothers Milton and Nelson Good had founded the company and used an American Oldsmobile as the foundation for their first car. They converted an American Mobile steamer to run on petrol, it was a single-cylinder engine in its final form. However, even this Canadian automobile did not come with a braking system. To stop the car, the driver was supposed to use the reverse pedal and bring the car to a stop. This was due to the epicyclic transmission that the vehicle had. While the Le Roy automobile can be considered as the first-mass production car to go on sale in Canada. The business did not grow and the company was shut by 1907.Oldsmobile Model 6C 'curved dashboard' Source: By DougW at English Wikipedia Ford Motor Company of Canada (1904):While the Le Roy Manufacturing Company failed to succeed, around the same time Henry Ford struck a deal with Canadian Gordon M. Mcgregor of Windsor and set up the Ford Motor Company of Canada in 1904. This was just a year after production of Ford cars had started back in Detroit, United States. Offering two car models that did get brakes, Ford found success in Canada with the Model C and the world famous Model T car.Ford Model T - Source: Wikipedia - By ModelTMitchWhy we don’t see Canadian only cars till today:Canada’s automobile market has always been under heavy American influence, while domestic OEMs failed to succeed, American brands such as Ford, Buick, Pontiac and Chrysler did well in the market and were trusted by the Canadian public. However in a bid to protect local manufacturing, Canada did impose a tariff on imported cars back in 1936. This prompted American carmakers to develop and produce Canada-only models such as the Ford Monarch, Chrysler Fargo and the Pontiac Beaumont. While these cars costed less for the Canadian car buyer, the country eventually realised that tariffs on imported cars was actually harming its economy by limiting trade with its biggest contributor, America. By 1965, the Canadian government removed the tariffs imposed in imported cars and the era of Canada-only cars came to an end with the exception of some cars voluntarily being created only for Canada such as the Chevrolet Corvair in the 1960s.Pontiac Beaumont 1960's - Source: Wikipedia - By M 93 Indian auto brands finding success in Canada:Currently, Indian brands such as Tata Motors and Royal Enfield are offering their entire portfolios to the Canadian public.

Additionally, under the Bus Body Code, it will be mandatory to get bus body certification from government recognised testing agencies from mid 2025. The notification has also proposed the installation of special ‘indirect vision’ devices, over and above the rear view mirrors, to help guide bus drivers and make manoeuvres more safe. Nissan Magnite EZ Shift review: Most affordable AMT SUV but has a flaw | TOI AutoCurrent scenario:Right now bus body builders can self-certify whether they are complying with the Bus Body Code or not. However, the new mandate from the Road Transport Ministry prescribes bus body builders to get certification from government agencies such as ARAI and ICAT. The updated Bus Body Code also specifies guidelines for location of emergency exits, spacing between the seats, electric wiring, structure vibrations, braking performance and vehicle stability function that need to be complied with.What are the ‘indirect vision’ devices:Bus drivers often do not get the full vision of what’s behind their vehicles or in their blindspots. ‘Indirect vision’ devices or more simply, camera systems and digital monitors that help mitigate this problem. They can be compared to Level 1 ADAS safety systems that we see in modern cars such as the Blind Spot Detection systems. Cameras placed on the blind spots and at the rear, can project a clear and real-time video feed of what’s happening onto displays placed in front of the driver. This makes the buses, passengers and commuters on the road safer.

       "       \" and Meta are two of the biggest, if not only, players in the mixed-reality segment. Meta has established its presence in this domain for several years, but Apple's recent unveiling of its Vision Pro has undoubtedly made a significant impact, altering the landscape.  The two companies are already readying the next iterations of their headsets, even though their current ones are still to hit the shelves, as they plan to mainstream VR. Apple is wanting to make its headset more comfortable, notes Mark Gurman of Bloomberg in the latest edition of his newsletter Power On, while Meta is taking cues from Apple's Vision Pro for its next headset, ditching the controllers to make Quest a little more affordable. Gurman writes that Apple is confident that the Vision Pro is superior. However, there are concerns over whether consumers will see the need for the device, given its high price of $3,500.  Meta, on the other hand, believes that the Quest 3's gaming ecosystem and $500 price tag make it a more appealing option. While it's difficult to bet against Apple, Meta can adjust its features based on what Apple adds to the Vision Pro and how customers respond to the technology. But Vision Pro has caused some turmoil inside Meta.  Meta is afraid of Apple, according to an insider. “We’re in the ‘afraid of Apple’ stage,” told the person, much like how the mobile industry was before the   launch. Zuckerberg shifting Quest’s focus from the metaverse to gaming and productivity, is the direct response to Apple's Vision Pro, which is what even Apple is doing. Meta is developing a cheaper, more comfortable headset called Ventura. They plan to remove bundled controllers, allowing users to use hand gestures or buy controllers separately. Meanwhile, Apple aims for a lighter and smaller successor to the Vision Pro, which even comes with built-in prescribed lenses. That’s not it; Headsets are the beginning of this segment, and glasses are to be the next big thing, at least that's what Meta hopes for. Even though Apple stopped work on AR glasses a year ago, Meta still sees them as its holy grail and plans to release AR display glasses in 2025.

       "       \"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das recently proposed the introduction of card-on-file tokenisation (CoFT) facility at the issuer-bank level. He cited the growing acceptance and benefits of tokenisation of card data while announcing the proposal. For those unaware, RBI introduced new channels for card on file for tokenisation. This means that credit/debit card users will be able to generate card tokens on their bank’s website or app instead of e-commerce websites/apps while shopping online, as is the case at present. This will eliminate data security concerns regarding token generation at e-commerce or merchant portals. The move also aims to give customers greater control over managing their card tokens. What the RBI announcement means To recall, RBI introduced Card-on-File Tokenisation (CoFT) in September 2021 and began implementation from October 1, 2022. So far, over 56 crore tokens are reported to have been created on which transactions with value of over Rs 5 lakh crore have been undertaken. Tokenisation is also said to have improved transaction security and transaction approval rate.  Until now, the cardholders had to create different tokens through each merchant’s application or webpage. This would require time and effort from the users. Going forward, tokens will be created at the issuer bank level and linked to their existing accounts with various e-commerce applications. This will eliminate the duplication of tokenisation process at each app or website along with increased transaction security, resulting in reduced card-data-related frauds.  What exactly is tokenisation Tokenisation replaces a debit or credit card’s 16-digit number with a unique token that is specific to user's card and specific for one merchant at a time. The token hides the true details of your card, so that in case a data leak happens from the merchant website, the hackers cannot misuse the card. This token contains no personal information and keeps changing. Tokens can be used for online transactions, mobile point-of-sale transactions, or in-app transactions. A customer can choose whether or not to let his, her card tokenised. Tokenization guidelines are applicable to both debit and credit card and have to be tokenized for future online purchase as opted by customers.

       "       'Some industry bodies have countered telecom companies demands to regulate OTTs and charge them ‘fair share’ by submitting counter comments on the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) consultation paper on the regulatory framework for OTT communication services and the selective banning of OTT services. For clarity, the recent proposal from TRAI on selective banning of OTT or internet services has resulted in a fierce debate among the industry bodies, internet companies and startup founders. The Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) said the majority of ‘OTT services’, are in addition to, and not in derogation or substitution of, traditional telecommunications (or broadcasting) services. \"OTTs provide bundled services that cannot be separated into ‘OTT Communication Services,’ ‘OTT Broadcasting services,’ etc., making defining OTT overall or subsets of OTT for regulatory purposes near impossible,” ITI said in a statement. However, the functions of these OTT services are already regulated under the IT Act 2000. Broadband India Forum (BIF) said that the demand for network usage fees from OTTs by telecom operators is outdated and would violate net neutrality principles. “Overregulation of the OTTs would be counterproductive, as this will lead to a higher cost to customers and reduce consumer choice. Besides, it would also adversely impact innovation, lead to discrimination, adversely impact smaller entities and startups, and lead to a violation of Net Neutrality guidelines,” said T.V. Ramachandran, BIF President. The Alliance of Digital India Foundation (ADIF), a policy think tank for digital startups, said that calls for revenue-sharing arrangements between telecom service providers (TSPs) and OTT applications are primarily grounded in the misperception that OTTs are benefiting without making any contributions. “The proposed implementation of the suggested revenue-sharing model carries the potential to discourage the growth of digital enterprises. This model introduces a volume-based revenue-sharing system that could impede their sustained expansion,” the ADIF said in a statement. Additionally, it introduces an additional cost associated with accessing free or affordable content, and a portion of this expenditure may eventually be passed on to consumers, thereby increasing the cost of internet usage. The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) saod that robust regulatory frameworks for digital service providers already exist in India. “They are also variously required to comply with the Consumer Protection Act and Rules for consumer welfare, and the Competition Act for economic regulation. Under the IT Rules, digital service providers/OTT service providers are subject to dedicated compliance and reporting requirements. Therefore, the introduction of a telecom regulatory regime for OTT services would undoubtedly qualify as an act of over-regulation,” the IAMAI argued.

This long secure length is said to be the highest achieved so far, not only in India but globally, for the Differential Phase Shift (DPS) QKD protocol, according to officials. \"Such low quantum bit error rate (QBER) makes the quantum communication resistance to collective and individual attacks and implementable for various applications, such as securing financial transactions, medical records and secret codes,\" said Bhaskar Kanseri, lead researcher and associate professor at IIT-Delhi\\'s Physics Department and Optics and Photonics Centre. \"It is also capable of securing network communication such as Internet of Things (IoT) and ready to revolutionise the field of cyber security,\" Kanseri said.

Earlier, Google introduced a cross-device feature that allowed users to move voice calls between devices. Now, the company may soon allow Android users to transfer video calls as well.  What is Device Groups and how will it work A blog post by TheSpAndroid (spotted by 9to5Google) claims that Google is moving away from “Link your devices'' phrasing for this feature and will instead call it “Device Groups.” This feature will enable users to add devices to a group that are linked to their Google account during setup, or invite them later on. The report has also shared the screenshot of a pop-up that will appear ahead of initial setup. This pop-up will bring out two use cases. One of them is the ability to transfer an active video call between devices. In the image, Google explains how this feature will work. The company claims:: “See ongoing video calls from other devices and seamlessly move them here.” The report couldn’t explain how the feature will look like in action, but it may work on an app-by-app basis using the cross-device SDK that Google has detailed on Android’s developer site. Google Meet is expected to be the first platform to support Device Groups. The pop-up will also offer another use case which will be the ability to “share internet access when your other devices are offline.” With this feature, users will be able to enable or disable hotspots on another device in the group. The report also didn’t mention when Google is planning to release this functionality for Android users. However, the company is expected to make these features available soon.

       "       \"Spotify has introduced a new feature for its Premium subscribers who love listening to audiobooks. Starting today, users in the UK and Australia can access over 150,000 audiobooks without additional cost, which will be available for subscribers in the US later this year. While users can choose to listen to as many audiobooks as they want out of the vast collection of more than 150,000 titles, they will be limited to 15 hours of free listening time. If users wish to listen more, they will need to purchase additional hours at a rate of 10 hours for $11. As of now, this is exclusively available to individual Premium subscribers and Family or Duo accounts' plan managers. However, Spotify plans to expand its availability in the future. Those not subscribed to Premium or the ones who are subscribed can still purchase any title they want from Spotify's audiobook library without having to pay for additional hours if they have specific books in mind.  “Audiobooks today have one big dominating player. And just like in music and podcasting, we believe that many more consumers want to consume audiobooks and want to listen to audiobooks,” said Spotify founder and CEO Daniel Ek, speaking at the event hosted in the company's New York offices on Tuesday. “And just like in music and podcasting, we’re really excited to be able to bring all the amazing tools that we built for creators and consumers alike to enable more discovery of these amazing audiobooks to the entire world.”  There is an auto-bookmarking tool that will save users time from having to repeat pages. Then, users can activate the Spotify Sleep Timer which will allow users to fall asleep while listening to their books without having to rewind when they wake up. And subscribers can download audiobooks for offline listening. Alex Norstrom, the co-president and chief business officer of Spotify, said there are already tens of millions of Premium subscribers who are interested in listening to audiobooks, but they lack the opportunity. He also mentioned that although it's estimated that 2 billion people will read a book this year, audiobooks make up only a small portion of that number.

In contrast, BJP satraps likeHere, Congress hopes Kamal will bloomThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is going into the upcoming assembly election in Madhya Pradesh without a chief ministerial face for the first time in decades. In past elections, the party had projected incumbent CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan as their face, but the 2018 loss may have caused them toAage dhamake hee dhamake hone wale hain, Diwali ka tyohar aanewala hai (every list is explosive, expect fireworks, Diwali is ahead),\" Mishra told reporters at the state BJP media office in Bhopal on Wednesday.Sources in the state BJP said that many \"non-performing\" MLAs may be dropped in the final list. The BJP has 67 of the remaining 94 constituencies. The CEC could drop 25 to 30 of the BJP MLAs because surveys have found that people in their constituencies are not happy with their work, say sources.\"The party feels that nearly half of these incumbent legislators will not be able to win their seats. New faces may be given tickets,\" a senior BJP leader explained.In the fourth list, announced on Monday, most ministers of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government were fielded from their respective constituencies. Budhni: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan appears to be fighting a lone battle these days. And most of the 2.7 lakh voters of his constituency, Budhni, aren\\'t happy about it. They feel their Mama is being sidelined by the party leadership, and are seething.Chouhan has bared his heart before them in recent days, saying they will \"miss him\", and asking them if he should become chief minister again. As Chouhan faces the toughest challenge of his political career, his supporters in Budhni are bristling at what they see as his neglect by the party.Budhni, around 70km from Bhopal on the banks of Narmada, has elected Chouhan five times to the assembly. Since 2006, people of Budhni are known as Shivraj\\'s own. It\\'s been the CM\\'s constituency for 17 years and comes with its perks and pride.But with the BJP not declaring Chouhan the party\\'s CM face this time, the voters of Budhni are angry and even threatening an agitation. When TOI visited Budhni on Wednesday, people\\'s angst was palpable, while they clung to hope that he would make a comeback. \"I want to see Mama as CM. Otherwise we will sit on dharna,\" said an agitated Ajay Manjhi from Jhanda Chowk area.Chouhan\\'s name wasn\\'t on the first three lists, leading to murmurs in his camp. On September 22, it was Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who led BJP\\'s Jan Ashirwad Yatra into Budhni, Chouhan\\'s son Kartikeya at his side. Chouhan wasn\\'t there.After the second list was released on September 26 and seven heavyweights, including three Union ministers, were fielded, it was clear that the BJP central leadership was propping up multiple potential CM faces to counter anti-incumbency.Four days after that, on October 1, Chouhan was in Budhni\\'s Ladkui when he said: \"Aisa bhaiyya nahin milega. Jab mein chala jaunga, tab bahut yaad aaunga (You will not get a brother like me. When I go away, you will remember me a lot).\"Two days later, he asked voters: \"Should I contest the election or not? Should Mama become chief minister or not?\" The crowd shouted, \"Yes,\" and started chanting, \"Mama, Mama\".And on October 6, in Ujjain, he asked for the blessings of sadhus, saying, \"Guide me. Political roads are filled with turmoil. There is a threat that one can slip at every step. Sometimes, there arise many who put you in a \\'chakkar\\'.\"Chouhan\\'s statements in the past few days have given enough hints that he\\'s not happy with the way he is being treated despite being the longest serving CM of BJP from 2005 to 2023, barring 15 months Congress rule. And he is not one to take it quietly.Chouhan has deftly turned the spotlight on himself, projecting his achievements as chief minister, and asking, doesn\\'t he deserve to be the CM again? It\\'s a question BJP will find hard to ignore.\"Ma Narmada\\'s blessings will decide who will be the CM. Wait for the right time,\" says priest Gopiram at Narmada Ghat in Budhni.The people of his constituency have seen Chouhan rise in political stature where they see him today as the \"champion of MP politics\". And they bask in reflected glory.\"Aadhaar card with a Budhni address is all you need to gain entry to CM House. Mama recognizes me every time he sees me in Bhopal or Budhni. If Mama is not there at CM House, Mami (CM\\'s wife Sadhna Singh) meets us and ensures we get respect,\" said villager Tika Ram. \"Mama never discriminated.

       "       'NEW DELHI: The upcoming assembly elections in the key states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh may pose a challenge to the unity of INDIA (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) - a coalition of opposition parties formed to take on the ruling BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.As the Congress gears up for a direct contest with the BJP in the three Hindi heartland states, which the grand old party won five years back in 2018, it will have to contend with the presence of Aam Aadmi Party - which recently got the status of a national party and is determined to expand its base. The Congress and the AAP are allies in the anti-BJP front. However, as political rivals in several states the two parties share an uneasy relation.Assembly elections in Mizoram, Chhattisgarh, MP, Rajasthan and Telangana: Watch the complete scheduleFor the Congress, victory in these states will give the party an edge and also greater bargaining power in the opposition space. The Congress has government in four states as of now - Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, while the AAP is in power in two states - Delhi and Punjab.Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have traditionally seen a direct contest between the BJP and the Congress. In Chhattisgarh, however, some tribal-based regional parties have strong pockets of influence impacting the prospects of the two main contenders.Arvind Kejriwal has already announced that AAP will contest in all the three states. Soon after the Election Commission announced the poll schedule, Kejriwal said, \"We are prepared to contest the elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh with full strength.\"In fact, AAP leaders including Kejriwal have gone all out to target the Congress governments in the two poll-bound states. In Chhattisgarh, Kejriwal slammed the condition of government schools under the Congress rule and cited the success of his Delhi model. The AAP has also announced 10 \"guarantees\" which included Rs 3,000 monthly allowance for the unemployed, a monthly \"samman rashi\" assistance for women, free electricity, free school education, mohalla clinics.In the 2018 assembly polls, the AAP had fielded 85 candidates in Chhattisgarh. However, all of them ended up losing their deposits. In Rajasthan also, Kejriwal has promised several guarantees and sought votes to make a new Rajasthan - free of corruption. Kejriwal attacked Congress chief minister Ashok Gehlot for not taking any action against BJP\\'s Vasundhara Raje over corruption charges.“Their leader Sachin Pilot got tired of raising the issue, demanding action but Gehlot did nothing. If you want politics of friendship then vote for them (Congress-BJP) but if want politics of patriotism then vote for AAP,” he said.AAP leaders have been campaigning aggressively with poll guarantees in Madhya Pradesh also as they try to create space for the party in the poll-bound state. Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann, in one of his rallies, urged the people of Madhya Pradesh not to vote for the BJP or the Congress, alleging that they have entered into a deal to loot the public for five years each. The AAP is focusing on the Vindhya region of the state as it has won the Singrauli\\'s mayoral post in the last local bodies elections and cornered a sizable number of votes in the region. Before the announcement of the assembly poll dates, both Kejriwal and Mann have addressed meetings in the Vindhya region.The Congress leaders have reacted sharply to AAP attacks in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. However, the top party leadership has evaded any direct comments on the issue. It is still not clear if the two parties will enter into an alliance for the state polls. When asked if AAP will contest assembly elections as part of the INDIA bloc, Kejriwal said \"whatever happens will be apprised\".Perhaps, the aggressive AAP foray in the three states where the Congress has huge stakes could be a pressure tactic to ensure that the grand old party agrees to recognise AAP as the dominant force in Delhi and Punjab.However, if the alliance talks fail and AAP contests alone, it will be interesting to see which of the two main players - the BJP or the Congress - is impacted more.',\n",
       "       'PATNA: Even as the hooch tragedy in Bihar\\'s Saran district that claimed 73 lives sparked a blame game between the Grand Alliance and the lone opposition BJP, JD(U) President and chief minister Nitish Kumar\\'s \"Jo Piyega Woh Marega\" remark may come back to haunt him.While the seven party government in the state is claiming that the BJP is using constitutional institutions for its political interests, the saffron party termed the Nitish Kumar government as being insensitive towards the common man.Taking on the state government, Nikhil Anand, national general secretary of BJP\\'s OBC wing and party spokesperson, said: \"The hooch tragedy is a clear failure of the Nitish government and common people are its victims. Many of the deceased were sole earners of the family. The government machinery has failed to stop illegal operations of the liquor mafia.\"Threat of starvation is looming over families of those killed in the hooch tragedy. On the top of that, the chief minister of state is saying \\'Jo Piyega Wo Marega\\'. The state government refused to give compensation to the dependents of the victims. What is the fault of the families which lost their breadwinners.\"Anand said: \"The state government is claiming that only 42 deaths occurred due to hooch, which means that the authorities have conducted post-mortem examinations of only 42 bodies. The local villages claimed over 200 persons lost their lives in the tragedy and were cremated near railway lines, adjoining to roads and other places as they were allegedly pressurised by local police.\"What happened to those victims who were not recognised by the state government? Many of the victims did not have the money to cremate the bodies. The state government, which used to provide Rs 3,000 to the families who could not afford cremation of the bodies under Kabir Antesthi Yojana, did not even gave that to the families of hooch tragedy victims.\"The Nitish Kumar government is hiding the numbers. It is a clear violation of human rights and hence NHRC is investigating the incident to find out the actual numbers of deceased,\" he said.\"CM Nitish Kumar, Tejashwi Yadav and other leaders of grand alliance are alleging that why NHRC team did not go to Gujarat, MP, Haryana and Karnataka? Comparing hooch tragedies in other states with the one in Bihar is not justified. The Bihar government should accept its failure.\"Sources said that NHRC teams have prepared the list of deceased who were sole bread earners of their respective families, their financial status, number of children who lost their fathers and now reached a stage of starvation.Abhishek Jha, the national spokesperson of JD(U) told IANS: \"NHRC has a basic principle to protect human right violation in the country. In Bihar, there is no such violation of human rights. Hence, its investigation is not needed here.\"\"BJP in the last eight years has used constitutional bodies for its vested interest. Why has it not gone in other states where massive tragedies had happened in the past. It is an effort to build an atmosphere against the grand alliance government in Bihar and prepare a ground for future elections,\" Jha said.RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari told IANS: \"Everyone knows how the BJP misuses constitutional institutions for its political interests. The Narendra Modi government has been using CBI, ED, Income tax and other authorities to target political opponents.\"The NHRC investigation is underway on the same line to defame the Bihar government. It could be a bigger plan to declare that human right violation is taking place at a big scale and plan a roadmap for imposing the President\\'s Rule in the state.\"Jagadanand Singh, the state president of RJD, told IANS that he will comment on the issue only after the NHRC\\'s report appears in public domain.The Nitish Kumar government is firm on not giving the compensations to those who violated the liquor prohibition norms.In what appears to be an image building effort, for the last couple of days, Tejashwi Yadav can be seen distributing blankets to people in night shelters or those sleeping on roads.As two teams of NHRC are investigating in Saran, the state government is also on the toes and trying to establish the substances used in the manufacturing of liquor.\"During investigation, we have detected that a certain type of chemical was used in making of liquor. Our investigating teams have collected the samples and it will be matched with the chemical found in the viscera reports of deceased. Then we can reach a conclusion that the liquor got poisonous due to that chemical,\" said Jitendra Singh Gangwar, ADGP headquarters.\"We have arrested 153 persons who were involved in either liquor manufacturing or selling it in the district,\" he said.',\n",

Shah also had lunch at the Palace. Later, he reached the mela ground to lay the foundation stone of a new terminal at Gwalior airport, which is to be named after Scindia\\'s grandmother and (late) Madhavrao Scindia\\'s mother Vijayaraje Scindia.The new terminal building will be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 446 crore. The new terminal building will have an area of 20,000 sq metres as compared to the existing 3,500 sqm. After the expansion, the airport will have the capacity to park 13 planes as against the existing capacity for three aircraft, an official told IANS.While addressing the gathering, Shah said, \"Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia Airport in Gwalior is one of the most modern airports with the latest facilities. With the dedication with which this airport has been carefully planned, I think it will be one of the best airports in the country. Under the leadership of PM Modi, there has been a huge development of infrastructure in the country. Earlier 375 km of the railway line was laid in one year, today 1,458 km is being laid.\"Meanwhile, Shah lauded the work of the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh, and he also took a dig at the Congress and said, \"Madhya Pradesh has experienced the corrupt Congress government and has seen it all.\"Political analysts were of the view that Shah\\'s visit to Gwalior was scheduled to lay the foundation of the terminal, which is the expansion part of the existing airport in the city, but this visit has several messages for the people in the political gallery, especially for the state BJP unit.\"Shah\\'s visit to Jai Vilas Palace and having lunch there would be analysed in different aspects of politics, but out of all, one message was clear that Jyotiraditya Scindia\\'s graph has increased in the BJP. Secondly, it was an indirect reply to those (Congress leaders) who were saying that Scindia would not get as much respect in the BJP as he used to get in the Congress,\" said a political observer in Madhya Pradesh.Another political analyst claimed that inviting Shah to his hometown, Scindia has played to masterstroke to give an apt reply to his old political opponents, especially within the Madhya Pradesh BJP unit. \"Defeat in the Lok Sabha election from his family bastion -- Guna was a major setback for Jyotiraditya Scindia. After he joined the BJP, he received another setback when the BJP lost the mayoral seat in Gwalior against the Congress. Now, when the state Assembly elections are just a few months away, and Scindia\\'s name is already doing rounds for the leadership in Madhya Pradesh, this visit of Shah will give an extra edge to him,\" political analysts said.Scindia was personally monitoring the preparations for the event in Gwalior for the last few days. The BJP leaders, who are considered Scindia\\'s loyalists and are the ministers in Shivraj Singh Chouhan\\'s cabinet, were assigned specific roles for this event. Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and some other state ministers were present on the occasion.',\n",

But the success of the G20 summit has given the claim a heft and the party may wheel this out as one of its key planks in the coming state elections and in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.The consensus even on the most complex part of the Declaration - Russia-Ukraine war - has also been acknowledged by opposition leaders, including former diplomat and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor.

Modi underlined that it would create new opportunities for employment and self-employment in the country.\"Today, the whole world is of the belief that this century is going to be India\\'s century,\" the prime minister said as he credited the young population of India for this.The prime minister observed that when the elderly population is increasing in many countries of the world, India is getting younger with each passing day.\"India has this huge advantage,\" he stressed as he noted the world is looking towards India for its skilled youth.The prime minister suggested not to waste any opportunity being created and assured that the government is ready to support the cause.Modi highlighted the importance of the power of the youth in utilizing the strengths of any country such as its natural or mineral resources, or its long coastlines and said that the country develops more with stronger youth power thereby doing justice to the nation\\'s resources.Today, the prime minister emphasized that a similar thinking is empowering India\\'s youth, which is making unprecedented improvements in the entire ecosystem.\"In this, the country\\'s approach is two-pronged,\" the prime minister said.He explained that India is preparing its youth to take advantage of new opportunities through skilling and education as he highlighted the new National Education Policy which has been established after almost 4 decades.The prime minister also underlined that the government is establishing a large number of new medical colleges and skill development institutes like IITs, IIMs or ITIs, and mentioned the crores of youth who have been trained under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana.On the other hand, he stated that traditional sectors which provide jobs are being strengthened while new sectors that promote employment and entrepreneurship are also being promoted.The prime minister also mentioned India making new records in goods exports, mobile exports, electronic exports, services exports, defence exports and manufacturing, and at the same time creating a large number of new opportunities for youth in many sectors such as space, startups, drones, animation, electric vehicles, semiconductors, etc.Modi informed that India\\'s proposal regarding global skill mapping has been recently accepted at the G20 Summit, which will help in creating better opportunities for youth in the coming times.India\\'s unemployment rate for persons aged 15 years and above was recorded at a six-year low of 3.2 per cent during July 2022-June 2023, as per the Periodic Labour Force Survey Annual Report 2022-2023 released by the National Sample Survey Office this week.Joblessness or unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of unemployed persons in the labour force.Considering the importance of the availability of labour force data at more frequent time intervals, the NSSO launched the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) in April 2017.

       "       'Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday demanded a caste census to ensure \"justice\" with OBCs, SCs, and STs and slammed the ruling BJP in Madhya Pradesh, saying 250 scams have taken place during its 18 years in power. \"Recently Bihar has conducted a caste census and it was revealed that 84 per cent of the people belong to OBC (Other Backward Class), SC (Scheduled Caste), and ST (Schedule Tribe) categories in the state. But their numbers in jobs are very low. To know their exact numbers and to do justice with them, a caste census should be conducted in the country,\" she said. The Congress leader was addressing a public meeting in Mandla district ahead of the November 17 assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh. Besides announcing a slew of promises, including implementation of the Old Pension Scheme (OPS), Gandhi also declared that her party, if voted to power in MP, will provide not only free education to students from Std I to Std XII, but also give Rs 500 per month to students from Std I to Std VIII, Rs 1,000 a month to those in Std IX and Std X and 1,500 for Std XI and Std XII.

HP Governor warns against society division amid caste census debateThe Congress leader alleged that \"250 scams, including Vyapam, mid-day meal, and scholarship\" took place in the state which has been governed by the BJP for nearly 225 months. Invoking former prime minister and her grandmother Indira Gandhi, the Congress leader said she somewhat resembles her and therefore, she has to be more \"responsible for the people, especially the tribal population\". Gandhi said the Congress would implement a host of promises after \"coming to power in MP\". She also listed out some of them: implementation of OPS, gas cylinder for Rs 500, monthly dole of Rs 1,500 to women, loan waiver scheme, free 100 units of power per connection and 200 units at half price, free electricity to farmers for running up to 5 HP motors for agriculture, and a caste census.',\n",

In a freewheeling interview with ETimes recently, he spoke about coming from a family of music lovers, dealing with campismin the industry, his thoughts on music down South and more.Read Also\\'Kailash Kher is a dynamite when he takes over the microphone,\\' says music composer Pranaay - ExclusivePranaay, the music composer known for his work in the \"Baaghi\" series, recently showcased his Indian classical skills in the song \"Ho Tayyar\" from \"OMG 2\". In an interview, Pranaay expressed his gratitude for being part of a successful film with an important message. He also discussed the process ofDivya Kumar: Music Mafia seems like a scary word, but they do exist - ExclusiveSinger Divya Kumar exclusively told ETimes about his thoughts on the remix culture in Bollywood, music mafias, his bond with Amit Trivedi and Varun Dhawan, and more.Excerpts...Many people in the past have spoken about the music mafia in the industry. Have you ever experienced it in your career so far?I think music mafia is a very strong word and it\\'s not really like that. However, whether it\\'s the corporate world or the film world, there is campism, and even I suffered because of it. Also because I didn\\'t really want to do remakes of other songs, and I wanted to stick with the original music, which was not really the flavor of the season, and I\\'m glad that it\\'s getting over and people are now ready to accept original music.Not many people know that you started your career with \\'Raaz 2\\'. Tell us something about it.Getting \\'Raaz 2\\' is an exciting story itself. I used to teach guitar to students all over Mumbai to survive as a musician before I made it into Bollywood. And once I was travelling in the train, I got a call stating that Mukesh Bhatt and Mohit Suri, who wanted to meet me for a song. They asked me to get my guitar. I didn\\'t have my guitar with me at that time so I called my mother and I asked her to please get it at the railway station. So she very excitedly got the guitar and blessed me. And I took the guitar, went back to their office and I played my heart out. Bhat Sahab just looked at me, stared into my eyes and he said, \\'Okay, your song is selected. Come and shake my hand\\'. I shook his hand, he looked at me and he asked, Who will be the first person that you tell this news to? Your girlfriend or your mother?\\' I just laughed and I said, \\'Sir, I\\'ll tell my mother first\\'.You don\\'t come from a family with a musical background. How and when did the music bug bite you?I don\\'t come from a family of musicians, but I do come from a family of music lovers. My grandfather was a great KL Sehgal fan. And while growing up, I used to sing in the school choir. And I was probably the only non-Catholic child who would sing in the choir. And then, once I was in college, I started learning music formally. I learnt guitar from Mr Bismarck Roderick, piano from Mrs Maureen Rebello, and Indian classical from Shri Rajan Santramji. And that\\'s how my journey began.What are your opinions about music in Bollywood and music down South?I think the music in all industries is very unique whether it\\'s Hindi film industry or down South. Even in the South, the Malayalam music industry is very different and the instrumentation is very different from the Tamil and Tamil is also very different from Telugu and Kannada also has a very rich heritage so I think that when you compare industries you also have to see what is the foundation of music. Where we primarily do Hindustani classical, down South it used to be a Carnatic classical but now everything is mixed and everyone takes inspiration from all around the world, not only in India so I think it\\'s a very exciting time that we are now. The boundaries have ceased.Name one latest composition (apart from your own) that you absolutely loved in recent times.One song that really stood out for me in recent times was a song called \\'Ro Lain De\\' from the film \\'Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani\\'. It was beautifully composed by Pritam, lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya and it was so refreshing to hear Sonu Nigam\\'s voice. I mean, it is just ethereal the way he has sung it. And that\\'s one song that just came like a surprise in the film and it was such a beautiful, soulful number.Who did you grow up listening to? Is there anyone you look up to in the music industry?As a music composer, when I look back at my journey on what were my influences, I now realise that they were so varied. I used to listen to KL Saigal, SD Burman, RD Burman from the film music. And I would listen to Indian classical with Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, and also 90s was a very vibrant era, so we were also exposed to the Michael Jacksons and you know the Backstreet Boys and pop. And so I think I would say pop, rock, Indian classical, film music, it\\'s just an amalgamation of everything and that\\'s what I think has led me to experiment with so many different genres.What\\'s next?Next up is my own label Thriver Entertainment. We\\'re releasing two Tamil songs. It\\'s written by the brilliant Tamil lyricist Madan Karki and then I have many Hindi songs that I have composed that are going to be released independently. So I want to create a music label where it\\'s known for good original music, you know. No remakes, we promise!',\n",

One such controversy that is making headlines currently is related to singer Shubh and his canceled India Music Tour. It was an event that promised to be a grand celebration of music but ended up mired in controversy.It all started in March when Shubh shared a distorted map of India on his Instagram story. In the post, the map didn’t have regions like Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir. Accompanying the image was a caption that read, \"Pray for Punjab.\" This swiftly sparked criticism and allegations of tacitly supporting the Khalistani movement.He started getting backlash from different corners, and as it gained momentum, Shubh later removed the map from his Instagram story. In its place, he posted a simpler message that solely stated, \"Pray for Punjab,\" devoid of any accompanying visual element. While this alteration might have been an attempt at damage control, the initial post had already ignited significant scrutiny and raised questions about his stance regarding the Khalistan issue, leading to many issues, one being the cancellation of Shubh’s India Music Tour. Initially, Shubh didn’t react. His sponsors backed away, leading cricketers of India unfollwed him on social media, and he received a lot of flake. Finally, the artist has broken his silence over the matter. Taking to his social media story he wrote that as a young artist from Punjab, it was his dream to pin his music on the global map. However, the recent events have left him in a state of grief and he wishes to express himself.He confessed to being excited about the whole tour, and talked about the preparation, but unfortunately, fate had other plans. He further quoted that India is his country too, as he was born here. He expressed that he is proud to be a Punjabi and whatever he is today, he owes that to his land.Check out Shubh’s post on the India Tour controversy here:On the one hand, where a segment of the internet and many other people stood against Shubh, many artists from the Punjabi entertainment world showed their support for the artist.Sidhu Moose Wala’s team posted a story on the late singer’s official handle.

At that time the indie music scene was in its infancy. Since then Ashu, Kailash and myself have had incredible careers. We have all matured as musicians yet we all still possess the childlike enthusiasm of our younger selves. The song speaks of the innocence of that period of our lives when we were starting out. It was also the period when we were setting up Blue Frog and that Summer of breaking out into the world. So you could say that Summertime Rocks is a coming-of-age song that speaks from the heart!\"Describing his working experience while creating the music video with Ashu and Kailesh, he says, \"Summertime Rocks was composed and written in a day or so, I believe. Like all creative processes, someone has to always be ready to record the ideas as they happen! That was my responsibility. Ashu came up with the line Summertime Rocks and we started jamming on the idea. Midway through the verse, we felt the song needed another voice. We used to jam very often with Kailash in those days, so we called him, and he was in the studio the same afternoon. Within a few minutes, he came up with the first line: “Har pal jaata hai zindagi say, toh qyun na jeele khushi say…”, which was the perfect “sawaal” to set up the line: “Cos it\\'s the Summertime and its Rocks.”Talking about the whole idea behind Wah Wah Records, he mentioned, \"Wah Wah Records (WWR) is a culmination of my two-decade-long journey in the music business. I have produced music across various mediums- Films, theatre, advertising, documentaries, TV, Web Series and also my own music. Along the way, I have also co-founded blueFrog, performed and toured all over the world. It’s been an incredible journey and now it\\'s time to give back to the music fraternity that I have been a part of. We start out with Smoke Signals, then follow up with White Noise - an OST soundtrack that I also co-produced with Ashu. Mumbai Star - is the next one - a Bollywood-style musical that is touring Japan in November and December.\"When quizzed about how he strikes a balance between composing for a film and independent music, Dhruv stated, \"Whenever you are called to produce music for a film, there are various forces at play. You must navigate the director\\'s vision, the producer\\'s commercial concerns, and the lead actor\\'s preferences on voice while infusing your own perspective. Experience helps, but it\\'s important to retain the irreverence and spontaneity of youth. Creating your own music offers more freedom, but you must wear all the hats: CEO, CFO, marketing manager, etc. The responsibilities are multifold, but I\\'ve learned to compartmentalize and wake up early to get everything done.\"',\n",

       "       'Who can forget the winter of 1961? It was an unforgettable for Indian cinema. Two of its brightest stars, Uttam Kumar from Bengal and Shammi Kapoor from Bombay (now Mumbai), came together for the premiere of Kapoor\\'s film, ‘Junglee’, at Roxy Cinema in Kolkata. Uttam Kumar was wearing a dazzling diamond ring, a special gift from Kapoor who held immense admiration for the Bengali cine legend. Read AlsoBlast from the past: When Uttam Kumar said ‘NO’ to Raj Kapoor\\'s ‘Jagte Rahow’ and ‘Sangam’In 1967, Uttam Kumar finally made his Hindi debut in the film ‘Chotisi Mulaqaat’ opposite Vyjayanthimala. It was a remake of his Bengali cult classic ‘Agni Pareeksha’. However, the Hindi adaptation didn\\'t impress the audience. As the reel rolled, Uttam Kumar was utterly captivated by Shammi Kapoor\\'s enigmatic sense of rhythm and acting prowess. The camaraderie was palpable, and the two stars hugged each other warmly after the show, a mutual admiration society in full view.  Shammi Kapoor, who was a revolutionary figure in the Indian film industry during the \\'60s, was a devoted admirer of Uttam Kumar. His trips to Kolkata were never considered complete without watching Uttam Kumar\\'s latest films or meeting the actor in person. However, when Uttam Kumar’s Hindi film ‘Choti Si Mulakat’ failed to impress the audiences, Kapoor voiced his concerns candidly. He felt that Uttam Kumar should have never attempted to fill his shoes, advising that he was best suited for Bengali classics. According to Kapoor, Hindi cinema could not possibly do justice to the exceptional talent that was Uttam Kumar.  Uttam Kumar, revered as Bengal’s king of hearts, ambitiously ventured into Bombay’s film industry with \"Chhoti Si Mulaqat\" in 1967. Produced under his own banner, \\'Our Movies,\\' and with his brother Tarun Kumar serving as the executive producer, the film had a lot riding on it. It was based on a revered story by Ashapurna Devi, titled ‘Agni Pariksha’, and was essentially a remake of a 1954 film of the same name. That earlier film had cemented Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen as the quintessential romantic pair in Bengali cinema. For the 1967 venture, the screenplay was penned by Sachin Bhowmick and the dialogues by Abrar Alvi, under the direction of Alo Sirkar and cinematography by Kanai Dey. The music was scored by the legendary Shankar Jaikishan, and featured lyrics by Hasrat Jaipuri and Shailendra. With playback by iconic singers like Rafi, Lata Mangeshkar, Suman Kalyanpur, and Asha Bhosle, it was no surprise that the film’s music became a hit. Uttam Kumar was paired with Vyjayanthimala, a leading actress of that era, and was supported by an impressive ensemble cast, including Shashikala, Rajendra Nath, and Tarun Bose.  However, the film failed to resonate with audiences outside Bengal, which was a crushing disappointment. There’s been speculation that had Uttam Kumar opted for a Bombay-based director, perhaps someone like Shakti Samanta, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Asit Sen, or even Pramod Chakravorty, the film might have fared differently.',\n",

In all probability Ajay Devgn will be essaying the role of the stranger who brings destruction to the family.Since it is a usual trend for films to make their way to digital and OTT platforms after their theatrical release, Kumar Mangat and Abhishek Pathak have taken extra measures to hold back the release of Gujarati film on the internet.In an exclusive report done by ETimes, we revealed how the makers found out that Shemaroo had bought the perpetual rights from the original producers and they formed a contract with the original makers ((KS Entertainment, Patel Processing Studios and Ananta Business Corp in collaboration with A Big Box Series) to forbid Shemaroo from airing it on YouTube and/or OTT both. The producers requested Shemaroo who agreed because of Ajay's goodwill and they also had to pay a reduced amount to purchase the movie.\",\n",

       "       'Ludhiana: Apart from lodging six FIRs against a “fraud” travel agent, who was arrested by crime investigation agency (CIA) II on August 31, the police are probing 30 more complaints received against him, among which 10 are from the police personnel of different ranks. The CIA-II arrested Chirag Kapoor (33) of Gori Apartment in Chander Nager, who was wanted in five cases of fraud. The police had also recovered 20 passports, an SUV, and some documents from his possession. During the interrogation, the police found that the accused is still trying to convince the complainants to not lodge an FIR against him and rather give him time to arrange the visa or money.Inspector Beant Juneja, in-charge CIA-II, said earlier, Kapoor only had a ticketing licence. “He had links with agents and through them, he sent many people abroad. However, when lockdown was imposed due to Covid-19 and the processing of all visa-related files were stopped, he could not arrange visas for people from who he had taken money. Some of them then filed complaints against him. But one thing is sure that he never had a license required for sending people abroad,” he added.“We have at least 30 more complaints pending against him, which are being verified as according to Kapoor, those files are still in process. Some complainants, who are cops, visited us to meet Chirag. They wanted cases to be registered against him, however, Chirag convinced them to wait for some time. At first, the police will verify the fact and only then more cases may be registered against him,” the cop said.On asking how Kapoor got so many cops to fall into prey, Juneja said initially, Chirag had got some cops and their kins visas. His name was spread through word of mouth and therefore people, including police officials, approached him to get visas. ',\n",
       "       'BENGALURU: Much like other civic agencies that seldom stick to project deadlines, the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) too has been dragging its feet on executing work on a crucial project that will reduce distance between east Bengaluru and Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) and take the pressure off inner city roads.In 2020, the state government entrusted the agency with the task of constructing an alternative road to KIA from Budigere-Hoskote Cross Road, the aim being to decongesting city roads. Designed for vehicles to move at 80-100 kmph speed, the project was to benefit people living in Whitefield, KR Pura, Hoskote and eastern parts of Bengaluru.It has been over three years now but the agency is still buying time to complete the project. The total length of the four-lane road is 20km. The project cost was estimated at Rs 254 crore.MD of KRDCL, Lingamurthy G, blamed delay in land acquisition, shifting of utilities and clearance from the forest department for the tardy progress. Incomplete construction work on several stretches is only causing hardship to motorists. Chandrashekar Gowda, a taxi driver who often uses the road, said: “At present, people commuting from Whitefield and eastern parts of the city take the congested Outer Ring Road (ORR) stretch to reach the airport. Traffic gridlocks at Tin Factory, Kasturi Nagar, Nagawara and Hebbal make them very anxious about making it on time. Had the authorities completed this road, they could have avoided busy roads in city limits.” Manjunath Prasad, a resident of Budigere, said: “After the state government announced this project, a lot of residential projects and commercial establishments have come up in the area. Early completion of the road project will provide relief to not just those travelling to the airport, but also benefit villagers.” Prasad highlighted how lack of streetlights on the road posed risk for motorists at night. The alignment of the road starts from Hoskote-Budigere Cross and goes via Budigere-Singahalli Road and Mylanahalli. After Mylanahalli, the alignment gets integrated with the existing road located on the southern side of the airport. Air passengers will be able to reach KIA via the existing alternative road from Begur junction (Galamma Circle). Once the road is developed, the airport will be about 36km from Whitefield, 34from KR Pura and and 30km from Hoskote. But taking the ORR means people from these areas don’t just travel 20km extra, but also lose a lot of time at the busy junctions. ',\n",
       "       \"Raipur: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and senior Congress leaders from state will travel on a train to reach Bilaspur’s Takhatpur for a public event on Monday. The former Congress president is all set to travel like an “Aam Aadmi” in the passenger or sleeper class to reach Bilaspur. Party sources said Gandhi may travel by the Raipur-Bilaspur Intercity Express from Raipur at 11:15 am on Monday and return to Raipur by the LTT Express at 5 pm on the same day. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, deputy chief minister T S Singhdeo, and Congress state president Deepak Baij may also accompany Rahul Gandhi on the occasion.According to party sources, the Congress party has also arranged an alternate mode of transport by road or by air for Rahul Gandhi to reach Takhatpur. Speaking about Rahul Gandhi’s tour to Chhattisgarh, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Sunday, however, suggested that Rahul Gandhi should opt for traveling from Raipur to Bilaspur by road, instead of his plans to travel by train, in view of the frequent cancellations of passenger trains in the state. “The way the trains are being canceled, I would suggest him to go to Bilaspur by road and return by train due to the frequent delays and cancellations,” Baghel told reporters here. Thec chief minister took a dig at the BJP, saying that the railway minister is visible only during rail accidents, while the Prime Minister grabs all the attention whenever trains need to be flagged off. Reacting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagging off nine Vande Bharat trains across 11 states on Monday, Baghel said that many trains in Chhattisgarh catering to common passengers are frequently being canceled.“The trains that are flagged off are either small or have no passengers because the journey in these trains has become very expensive. The trains that used to have a continuous flow of passengers are being canceled every now and then, and the Prime Minister does not address this issue. Moreover, the inauguration of the rail corridor by the Prime Minister is not for the passengers; it is for coal transportation,” he said.Referring to the National Family and Health Survey report, the chief minister said that 40 lakh people have moved above the poverty line, with 88% of urban people using toilets. In rural areas, 73% of people use toilets. Overall, 76% of the population uses toilets, while 23% do not.He also said that the ODF Plus status has been declared for the state. “However, 16 lakh families still do not use toilets in the state. This was declared during Raman Singh's tenure,” Baghel said, allegeding a massive scam involving around 1.5 billion rupees has occurred in the construction of toilets.“Letters have been written to the central government, but no investigation is being conducted,” he said, adding that the leaders of the BJP are silent on this issue. “This also needs to be investigated by the ED and IT departments,” he added.\",\n",
       "       'Nagpur: Over 15 crore travelers who fall in the ‘senior citizens’ category as per the Indian Railways have travelled in trains without fare concessions withdrawn during the Covid-19 pandemic.Information obtained by Amravati-based activist Ajay Bose from the Railway Board under Right to Information Act (RTI) revealed that in the last three years (April 1, 2020 to July 31, 2023) a total of 15,26,53,426 senior citizens (men above 60 and women above 58 years of age) travelled without fare concession.The Railway Board informed that in 2020-21 the number of such passengers was 1,86,16,972, while in 2021-22 it was 5,44,48,061. In 2022-23, the number of elderly passengers rose to 7,95,88,393. All the previously existing fare concessions were withdrawn during the pandemic period starting March 20, 2020. Though the pandemic has subsided, the concessions have not been restored, pointed out Bose. Lawyer Sundeep Badana too had filed a PIL in the Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court on August 3, 2022, demanding restoration of fare concessions. A bench of Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice MW Chandwani on December 14, 2022, disposed of the PIL setting a three-month deadline from the date of the order for the Railways to take a decision. The high court order said, “Now that the Covid-19 pandemic has been abated, in the changed circumstances, it was necessary for the railways to take a fresh decision in respect of continuation of the withdrawal of concessions otherwise.”The Railway Board wrote a letter to Badana on January 24, 2023, stating that the board has examined the matter and found that the government is already giving huge subsidies on passenger services. “In 2019-20, the subsidy amount was over ₹59,000 crore. This amounts to 53% on average for every person, traveling on railways. This subsidy is continuing for all passengers. Further, concessions beyond this subsidy amount are continuing for defined categories of Divyangians, patients and students,” the Board stated.The High Court had in 2022 granted liberty to Badana to approach the court, if there is a fresh cause of action arising in the matter. In response, Badana filed a fresh PIL in the matter on August 23 this year.',\n",
       "       'Mangaluru: The critical condition of a nine-month-old girl from a health centre in Banakal, Chikkamagaluru district, forced a doctor to accompany her in an ambulance for a distance of 120km, to get the girl admitted to a speciality hospital here.The girl, a resident of Banakal, experienced seizures, and was immediately taken to Sai Krishna Health Centre in Banakal. Recognizing the severity of her condition, the medical team decided to shift her to a tertiary care facility here.The health centre is affiliated with Shri Krishna Hospital, Kakkinje, in Belthangady taluk. In light of this, Dr Madan Kumar G, chief medical officer of the health centre, Banakal, coordinated with Dr Murali Krishna Irwathraya, medical director of Shri Krishna Hospital. Following their consultation, a decision was made to transfer the infant to Mangaluru for further medical care.Dr Kumar G said, “ The parents had brought the infant about seven days ago for treatment. She was suffering from cold and fever, and had no other complaints. She was fine after four days of treatment, but after a week, she started developing fever. However, on Wednesday, the parents called me and said that their daughter had a seizure at 5 pm. I told them to rush the child to the hospital. At 11 pm, the child was brought to the centre after she had a second seizure. Looking at the infant’s condition, we decided to do a blood test, and found that she was suffering from severe infection. We consulted Dr Krishna and coordinated with Dr Jayaprakash of Srinivas Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Mukka, and it was decided to shift the child to Srinivas Hospital, as she needed treatment at a paediatric intensive care unit,” he said.The other doctor at Banakal Hospital was on night duty, and hence Dr Madan decided to accompany the patient, as her condition was critical. “Without thinking twice, I got into the ambulance with the necessary medicines. Fortunately, the journey to Mangaluru was smooth. We left at 12 am, went to Shri Krishna Hospital, where the child was shifted to an ambulance with better facilities. The patient was examined by Dr Krishna before we left for Mangaluru,” said Dr Madan.Dr Krishna said, “The patient was unconscious and after examining her and administering necessary medicines, she was shifted to a more advanced facility. It is a rare case where a doctor volunteers to accompany a patient in an ambulance late at night. By the time the patient was admitted to the hospital in Mangaluru and returned, it was about 7.40 am. The commitment demonstrated by this young doctor is commendable and deserves appreciation,” he said. ',\n",
       "       'NEW DELHI: A passenger travelling by Delhi Metro instead of a car saves almost 32.4 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilometre. Thus, a ride from Janakpuri West metro station on Blue Line to Hindon River metro station on Red Line would save about 840 grams of CO2 emissions while a one-way metro journey from MG Road station to Samaypur Badli station would save 1,420 grams of CO2.From Thursday, QR-coded tickets - both paper- and mobile-based - will show commuters the amount of CO2 saved every time they ride the metro. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Wednesday launched CarbonLite Metro Travel, an initiative to educate passengers about their significant contribution towards reducing carbon emissions by choosing metro trains, based on research done by The Energy and Resource Institute (TERI).The details on carbon emissions are currently unavailable for Delhi metro card users. The initiative aims to ensure widespread awareness of the positive impact of sustainable public transport.\"In line with India\\'s aim of achieving net zero emissions by 2070, the initiative intends to highlight the pivotal role each citizen plays in addressing the pressing issue of climate change through their transportation choices. DMRC is possibly the world\\'s first metro service to introduce such a feature in its tickets,\" said Anuj Dayal, principal executive director, corporate communications, DMRC.He added that the CO2 savings will be displayed and accumulated in the user\\'s DMRC mobile app for all journeys undertaken by the passenger, further enhancing the \\'feel-good factor\\'.For this initiative, a study done by TERI estimated the net CO2 emissions per passenger-km by Delhi Metro and five motorised modes of road transport - bus, private car, cab/taxi, three-wheeler (auto-rickshaw) and two-wheeler.\"Delhi Metro\\'s continuous efforts in environmental preservation have earned it a reputation as a frontrunner in sustainability within the global transportation landscape. The corporation holds the distinction of being the world\\'s first rail-based organisation to accrue carbon credits for innovative initiatives like regenerative braking and modal shift strategies. Additionally, DMRC has achieved significant strides in harnessing solar energy, with an impressive total solar power generation capacity of approximately 50 MwP, further solidifying its position as a pioneer in the mass transit sector,\" said Dayal.The introduction of QR-coded tickets on both paper and mobile platforms earlier this year has been met with enthusiastic responses from passengers. The app-based QR code ticketing option, launched by DMRC in June, has already garnered about 4.7 lakh downloads.\"This will encourage passengers to choose an eco-friendly mode of transport over motorised vehicles, contributing to a cleaner and greener environment,\" said DMRC.

       "       'LUCKNOW: Brace for bullet speed travel between Delhi and Varanasi via Ayodhya in the coming years. The train travel time, which takes around 11-12 hours at present will get reduced to 3 hours once the Delhi–Varanasi High-Speed Rail (DVHSR) project gets ready. The work has already started.The 865-km proposed High Speed Rail, commonly known as the Bullet Train, will connect Delhi with Varanasi through 12 stations including Lucknow, Ayodhya, Mathura, Etawah, Kannauj and Prayagraj.As per the project’s feasibility report, people will be able to travel between Delhi and Lucknow in 1 hour and 38 minutes.While the environment impact assessment, social impact surveys and utility identification along the proposed route are likely to start soon, the instructions are to avoid any forest or wildlife sanctuaries in the route.Besides connecting the national capital with several religious cities of Uttar Pradesh, the project is also expected to boost the real estate sector on the proposed rail route.The project will also benefit devotees who want to travel by train to Ayodhya, about 690km from Delhi, and currently takes more than 10 hours by train or road.The train will have a maximum speed of 350 kmph and an operation speed of 300 kmph. With a passenger capacity of 750, this train will be equipped with urgent earthquake detection and an alarm system for automatic braking.Multi-modal station integrationAs per the Prime Minister’s GatiShakti National Master Plan (NMP), the project will be integrated with the national multi-modal transport connectivity all along the route.In Delhi, for instance, interventions by means of foot overbridges (FOBs) with Metro stations, railway stations and the Inter-State Bus Terminus (ISBT), besides station parking facilities are proposed. Similar integrations at Noida are also proposed.At the underconstruction Jewar International Airport in Noida, the Jewar HSR station will be set up close to the airport and its integration by means of dedicated passenger walkway connection and underground roads to Metro and airport terminal buildings is proposed.At Lucknow, the HSR station is planned on the existing VIP road, about 0.5 km away from Singarnagar Metro station with which an foot overbridges connection is proposed. The Lucknow railway station will be about 5 km away and the distance to the Lucknow Airport will be about 4.5 km.The Lucknow-Ayodhya spur line (extension) alignment is proposed parallel to the existing railway line. The Ayodhya high-speed rail station will be about 2.5 km from the Ayodhya Airport and 10.5 km from the existing Ayodhya Railway Station. A proposed new road below the viaduct connecting to Prayagraj-Faizabad road will be explored.In Mathura, construction of new roads to connect Mathura and Vrindavan roads, dedicated bus facility and parking are proposed. In Agra, the extension of Agra Metro till the HSR station with parking and a dedicated bus facility will lead to a perfect integration.In Etawah, a new Etawah HSR station is planned along the Yamuna Expressway. The HSR station at Prayagraj will be 1 km from the existing Phaphamau railway station. Widening of roads and FOB connection between the HSR and railway station, widening of the bridge and increased regional commuter train services for integration with the existing Prayagraj railway station will also be explored.In addition, a water-based transport mode between the HSR station and Triveni Sangam could also be explored.In Varanasi, the proposed Banaras HSR station will be close to the existing Banaras (Manduadih) railway station. A foot overbridge connection between the two stations, parking plazas, redevelopment of Banaras railway station, a station square, a dedicated bus facility for destinations in Varanasi and integration of the high speed rail station with the proposed Metro and Ropeway Corridors may also be explored.Survey underwayThe Light Detection and Ranging Survey for DVHSR corridor began a few months ago. The LiDAR technology provides all the ground details and data in 3-4 months wherein this process normally takes 10-12 months. This technique uses a combination of laser data, GPS data, flight parameters and actual photographs to give accurate survey data. The report contains the survey of the entire route, including soil, terrain, rivers, drains and other vital information. The route alignment is planned along the existing Yamuna Expressway, Agra-Lucknow Expressway, forthcoming Ganga Expressway and the existing North Eastern Railway between Prayagraj and Varanasi.',\n",

Renowned designers such as Simone Rocha, JW Anderson, and Richard Quinn deliveredThis innovative styling hack was popularized by Lydia Langford, a fashion creator, and it has quickly gained a massive following on TikTok. The concept behind the \\'sandwich\\' styling hack is simple but effective: when putting together an outfit, coordinate the color or texture of your top and bottom garments. Lydia Langford explains this technique by saying, \"When putting together an outfit, consider choosing the same color on the bottom as you would the top. In this case, instead of wearing my black pumps, I choose to wear my white sandals to complete the look.\"Watch the video here:        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by ModeSens (@modesens) The \\'sandwich\\' styling hack, while making waves on TikTok, has actually been a part of the fashion industry for quite some time. This technique involves creating a balanced ensemble by coordinating two items with the same color or texture and adding a contrasting element in between. It\\'s a fashion approach that can transform any look, adding a touch of sophistication and coherence.What has led to the recent popularity of this styling hack is its simplicity and the pleasing aesthetics it offers. The \\'sandwich\\' method employs the power of symmetry to effortlessly enhance your overall appearance. Whether you\\'re heading to a relaxed brunch, a corporate event, or a gala dinner, this style rule adapts seamlessly to any setting, making it a timeless choice. One of the key advantages of this method is its ability to breathe new life into one’s existing wardrobe by combining clothing items in fresh and creative ways, thereby reducing the need for frequent shopping trips.So, how does it work in practice? Let\\'s take an example: a tailored black blazer as the \"bread,\" creates a sleek silhouette. High-waisted black trousers maintain the monochromatic theme, providing a clean foundation. The contrasting \"meat\" comes in the form of a vibrant silk scarf tied around the neck, making it a statement piece that elevates the entire ensemble to a new level of sophistication.Sandwich styling employs the power of symmetry to effortlessly enhance your overall appearance.  Source: PinterestThis styling approach extends beyond color coordination to the realm of materials and textures.One can play around with textures by wearing a soft, cashmere sweater with distressed denim jeans or try a faux fur jacket with sleek leather pants. Mixing and matching diverse textures gives the outfit depth and gains visual interest - turning a regular outfit into a stylish and captivating spectacle.The Week In FashionFurthermore, the \\'sandwich\\' styling hack opens up a realm of creative possibilities when it comes to playing with proportions and silhouettes. The freedom to experiment with contrasting sizes and shapes creates a visual dynamic that adds depth and a fashion-forward edge to the overall look. For example, pairing an oversized, slouchy sweater with tailored skinny jeans, achieves a captivating balance that exudes both comfort and style. Alternatively, combining a voluminous, flowy skirt with a fitted top creates a striking contrast that draws attention and showcases one’s fashion prowess.Beyond its versatility, it\\'s important to keep in mind that while the \\'sandwich\\' styling hack provides valuable fashion guidance, the ultimate rule of fashion is to express individuality. This technique should serve as a canvas for personal flair and comfort. Fashion is a potent form of self-expression, allowing people to communicate their personality, mood, and creativity. The \\'sandwich\\' method is just one of many tools in one’s sartorial toolkit, enabling a person to craft and narrate their distinct fashion story with confidence and authenticity. So, while embracing the technique is key, it is always important to remember to let individuality shine through, as it\\'s the key to making any outfit truly one’s own.',\n",

Sorbet & Metallic Seduction Fendi unveiled the new S/S 24 with Sorbet Shades like Orange and yellow with the asymmetry of cuts matching against powder hues. Del Core created “Slices Of Reverie” in the seduction of transparency while Alberta Ferrati chose fuchsia along with whites and browns. Etro created sorbet in signature prints while Genny opted for striking red with whites and rose gold in the collection “The Orchid Garden”.

Where quiet luxury was mainstream and garments were more towards subtle sophistication of finishing, cuts and authenticity. Brands such as Act N1 and Philosophy did indulge in all the trends we churned out above but the most targeted area was the finishing touch. Tom Ford marked the debut of creative director Peter Hawking exploring all cuts Italian for the spring/summer 24 collection. Prada was the classic match for Italian luxury which is a more finishing-centric, womenswear collection formal silhouette, borrowed from menswear and reimagined in architectural forms that reconsider the archetypal contours of formal rigour. Many classic Italian brands propose absolute freedom of the body expressed in lightweight dresses in floaty fabrics that challenge the language of classic tailoring because that’s the most significant value of Italian brands. They are known for their finishing touch and tailoring in subtle colours and rich fabrics.A model wears a creation as part of the Gucci women's Spring Summer 2024 collection presented in Milan, Italy, Friday, Sept. 22, 2023.

We spotted all the essentials in this season. Milan Fashion Week was metaphysical by all means. Cooler temps took over Milan in between the evenings, so showgoers had their knitwear game on point, including a few cosy crewnecks here and a statement cardigan touch there. Oversized blazers and tailored coats with tiny bralettes underneath are still stealing the street show along with sneakers, chunky loafers, and neon-tinted heels for a splash of colour. Milanese will never disappoint us with the pop of colours no matter what age group or gender they belong to. Via Monte Napoleone is all about smart Italians flaunting their vibrancy in fine-tailored neon pops whether it’s ready-to-wear or leather accessories. \",\n",

One of her recent sari looks styled by Who Wore What When caught our attention. It was a stunning Rangkat sari from the label Shanti Banaras. The sari was an amalgamation of warm earthy hues such as gold, green, peach, and shimmering bronze and had colourblocking hatchwork motifs throughout the body.

And if you are wondering what is a Rangkat sari and what makes it so special? Here is everything you need to know about this exquisite weave.Vidya Balan is a connoisseur of Indian textiles. In the picture she is seen wearing the rangkat sari from Banaras. Source: Shantibanaras What is a Rangkat sari?A Rangkat sari is a type of Banarasi sari that is made using a complex and intricate technique of weaving. The word Rangkat means \"colored warp\" in Hindi, and refers to the process of dyeing the warp threads in different colors to create patterns on the fabric. The weft threads are usually plain or zari, and are used to bind the warp threads together. The result is a vibrant and colorful sari that has motifs on both sides of the fabric.What are the features of a Rangkat sari?A Rangkat sari is characterized by its rich colors, fine texture, and elaborate designs. The motifs are usually inspired by nature, such as flowers, birds, animals, and geometric shapes. The border and the pallu of the sari are often embellished with zari or brocade work, adding to the elegance and grandeur of the sari. A Rangkat sari can weigh up to 1.5 kg, depending on the amount of zari used.(In Picture) Colourful rangkat sari with nature inspired motifs. Source: PinterestHow to style a Rangkat sari?A Rangkat sari is a versatile piece that can be worn for various occasions, from weddings to festivals to casual outings. The best way to style a Rangkat sari is to let it be the star of the show and keep the rest of the look simple and minimal. A solid-colored blouse that matches one of the colors in the sari is a good choice, as it will not clash with the vibrant hues of the sari. Alternatively, one can opt for a contrasting blouse that adds some drama and contrast to the look. For accessories, one can go for statement earrings or necklaces that complement the sari, or keep it subtle with small studs or bangles. A sleek bun or a low ponytail will complete the look with grace and elegance.Vidya Balan\\'s beautiful Rangkat sari is a testament to her impeccable taste and her support for local weavers and artisans, which she has done quite often and throughout her career as an actor.

       "       'She was first seen in Bigg Boss OTT and little did anyone know that this girl from Lucknow will become the most famous internet personality in a short span of time. It all started with Uorfi Javed stepping out wearing the most anomalous outfits and a bunch of paparazzi sharing her videos on their Instagram handles. To say that her outfits were questionable is subjective, but she certainly learnt how to remain in the limelight with all that paraphernalia used in creating her dresses. She is capable of making a top from bubble gum or a dress from a trash bag. Some may find it distasteful, but if you are someone who thinks fashion is a form of self-expression then perhaps Uorfi is doing it right.In a previous interview given to The Times of India, Uorfi had explained why she likes to dress up differently, \"Whatever I do, I do for myself because all of us want to look and feel good. And if people get provoked by a dress, then there is a problem there... they need help,\" she had claimed.Uorfi has made a living out of her quirky dressing sensibility. She earns more than a lot of other TV stars or influencers. From being a DIY queen to everything in between, Uorfi has made the adage - fake it till you make it, absolutely true for herself.Even the leading names in fashion industry approve of Uorfi\\'s style now. She had recently attended the store launch of designer Amit Aggarwal in New Delhi and the designer believes that Uorfi is unapologetically herself in the way she dresses up. \"I often look at Uorfi\\'s journey as a one of transformation, that metamorphoses everyday into something new. It’s clear as day that she thoroughly enjoys the process of putting together looks and has fun with clothing. She isn’t afraid to express herself through fashion and isn’t that what fashion is eventually all about ?

       "       'NEW DELHI: India wants Saudi Arabia\\'s Aramco to participate in its planned 6.5 million metric tons (MMT) strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) programme as the South Asian nation wants to strengthen ties with its key oil supplier, according to a document seen by Reuters. The two nations have been talking about Aramco\\'s participation in the SPR programme for years. The talks, however, gained traction after Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman\\'s meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month. \"Under Phase II Strategic Petroleum Reserves Programme construction of two new commercial-cum-strategic petroleum reserves of 6.5 MMT have been approved,\" the Indian government said in an internal document, adding that \"Saudi Arabia\\'s Aramco can be invited to participate in the Phase II.\" Aramco declined to comment, while the Saudi government did not respond to emails seeking comment.  India\\'s prime ministers office, oil ministry and finance ministry did not respond either. In 2021, India overhauled its SPR policy allowing commercial sale of the crude to boost private participation in the building of new storage facilities, mirroring a model adopted by countries such as Japan and South Korea. India, the world\\'s third-biggest oil importer and consumer, imports over 80% of its oil needs and has built strategic storage at three locations in southern India to store over 5 million tons of oil to protect against supply disruption. Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) has leased 750,000 tons of oil storage in the 1.5 million ton SPR in the southern city of Mangaluru. India has conducted two road shows for the second phase of its SPR programme that received interest from companies including Trafigura, British Petroleum, Petrochina, Hyundai, Gulf Energy, Glencore and Shell, a government statement said. Regarding a potential deal between India and Saudi Aramco, KPMG Partner Anish De commented: \"Getting the investment there will align the economic and political interest. There is good economic and political reasons for the two countries to do it.\" During the visit by the crown prince to India, Saudi Arabia announced plans for an investment facilitation office in India\\'s Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, a tax-neutral financial service centre.  India is also scouting for land to build a 1.2 million metric tonnes per year refinery and petrochemical project in western India with participation of Saudi Aramco and ADNOC. The two governments will form a task force to remove hurdles like land acquisition, which has delayed the project, which was conceived in 2018.

Quotas for some overseas sales can be issued if domestic supply improves, they said.India recorded its weakest monsoon in five years and any drop in agricultural output will heap pressure on the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to control food inflation ahead elections next month and in 2024. Export curbs will squeeze the market and likely boost futures in New York and London.A spokesperson who represents India’s food and commerce ministries didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.India introduced a quota system in 2022-23 and restricted sugar exports to about 6 million tons after late rains reduced production, compared with an unrestricted 11 million tons a year earlier.According to a Bloomberg survey of 14 analysts, traders and millers last month, most said India may not export any sugar this season due to lower output. Two respondents said shipments could total at least 2 million tons.Raw sugar futures surged to a 12-year high in September on concerns around tight supply, despite a bumper harvest from Brazil, the world’s top producer. Some parts of India’s Karnataka and Maharashtra states — key growing regions — were among the driest areas this monsoon, according to the weather office.Output from Thailand, the world’s second-largest exporter, is poised to slide by almost a fifth in the upcoming harvest because of a severe drought, according to an industry group estimate last month.

They’re part of a larger consortium in talks for the syndicated loan to billionaire Gautam Adani’s conglomerate. Some institutions were in discussions to lend $400 million each, in what could become one of the biggest loan deals in Asia this year, Bloomberg reported last month citing people familiar with the matter. No new information was given on the status of that group of banks. The prospective deal adds to evidence that the group, with business interests stretching from ports to green energy, is closing the chapter on the allegations of malfeasance made by US shortseller Hindenburg Research earlier this year. The claims — repeatedly denied by Adani officials — caused a selloff in the stocks and bonds of group firms. Negotiations with global banks on debt refinancing stalled as some banks balked, Bloomberg reported in February. Spokespeople at Barclays, Deutsche and Standard Chartered all declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg on Tuesday. A representative for Adani Group did not offer any immediate comment.Adani bought the India assets of Switzerland’s Holcim Ltd. in 2022, as the conglomerate looked to move beyond its core business of operating ports, power plants and coal mines and into areas like data centers, airports, digital services, retail and media.

A majority of buyers hail from the Delhi NCR region. Notable property owners at The Camellias include Aman Gupta, founder of BoAt; JC Chaudhry, founder of Aakash Educational Services; and the Elan Group, a real estate firm.

In simple terms, an apartment purchased for Rs 23 crore in 2014, spanning 10,000 square feet, is now valued at nearly four times its original price, at Rs 85 crore.This trend of high-value apartment transactions is also gaining ground in Delhi, with transactions surpassing Rs 1 lakh per square foot.

He added that it was not practical and realistic for the agency to give a list of such projects in advance.With its borrowings increasing and several projects stuck midway, DJB has been demanding additional funds from Delhi government, leading to a special audit being conducted by the finance department. Sources claimed there were several instances where DJB diverted funds earmarked for capital projects for smaller works.Apart from seeking the detailed accounts of revenue collection, funds and grant-in aids received by it and expenditures in the last five years, the finance department is looking minutely into every rupee spent by the agency now.A senior DJB official claimed the agency has got more allocation under the head where the expenditures are less but less funds for sectors that require larger spending. He claimed the money allocated for the drainage sector has been bifurcated into \\'Yamuna cleaning\\' and \\'non-Yamuna cleaning\\' heads, leading to a crisis of sorts. \"Most of the allocated funds for the drainage sector have been lying unutilised under the head of \\'Yamuna cleaning\\' while most of the projects related to the drainage sector are suffering due to unavailability of money,\" the official said.\"There is an urgent need for re-appropriation of funds within DJB.

The watchmaker had reportedly crashed the steam buggy into a creek soon after introducing it to the world.Is Nissan too late taking the AMT route with the Magnite EZ Shift? | TOI AutoCanadian auto industry takes shape (1899):The automotive industry in Canada actually started to take off almost three decades after Taylor’s failed steam buggy concept. It began with the arrival of the Le Roy Manufacturing Company in 1899. Brothers Milton and Nelson Good had founded the company and used an American Oldsmobile as the foundation for their first car. They converted an American Mobile steamer to run on petrol, it was a single-cylinder engine in its final form. However, even this Canadian automobile did not come with a braking system. To stop the car, the driver was supposed to use the reverse pedal and bring the car to a stop. This was due to the epicyclic transmission that the vehicle had. While the Le Roy automobile can be considered as the first-mass production car to go on sale in Canada. The business did not grow and the company was shut by 1907.Oldsmobile Model 6C 'curved dashboard' Source: By DougW at English Wikipedia Ford Motor Company of Canada (1904):While the Le Roy Manufacturing Company failed to succeed, around the same time Henry Ford struck a deal with Canadian Gordon M. Mcgregor of Windsor and set up the Ford Motor Company of Canada in 1904. This was just a year after production of Ford cars had started back in Detroit, United States. Offering two car models that did get brakes, Ford found success in Canada with the Model C and the world famous Model T car.Ford Model T - Source: Wikipedia - By ModelTMitchWhy we don’t see Canadian only cars till today:Canada’s automobile market has always been under heavy American influence, while domestic OEMs failed to succeed, American brands such as Ford, Buick, Pontiac and Chrysler did well in the market and were trusted by the Canadian public. However in a bid to protect local manufacturing, Canada did impose a tariff on imported cars back in 1936. This prompted American carmakers to develop and produce Canada-only models such as the Ford Monarch, Chrysler Fargo and the Pontiac Beaumont. While these cars costed less for the Canadian car buyer, the country eventually realised that tariffs on imported cars was actually harming its economy by limiting trade with its biggest contributor, America. By 1965, the Canadian government removed the tariffs imposed in imported cars and the era of Canada-only cars came to an end with the exception of some cars voluntarily being created only for Canada such as the Chevrolet Corvair in the 1960s.Pontiac Beaumont 1960's - Source: Wikipedia - By M 93 Indian auto brands finding success in Canada:Currently, Indian brands such as Tata Motors and Royal Enfield are offering their entire portfolios to the Canadian public. From the Tata Tiago.ev, Safari to the Royal Enfield Classic 350, Himalayan and Interceptor 650. As the Indian automotive sector continues to grow we can expect more Indian vehicles to be seen in Canada but the likelihood of a mass-market Canadian vehicle making a global impression remains almost nill. \",\n",

       " 'According to a fresh draft proposal, the Road Transport Ministry has submitted their intention to add two new mandates, to improve vehicle and passenger safety of both OEM-built and coach-built buses in the country. Additionally, under the Bus Body Code, it will be mandatory to get bus body certification from government recognised testing agencies from mid 2025. The notification has also proposed the installation of special ‘indirect vision’ devices, over and above the rear view mirrors, to help guide bus drivers and make manoeuvres more safe. Nissan Magnite EZ Shift review: Most affordable AMT SUV but has a flaw | TOI AutoCurrent scenario:Right now bus body builders can self-certify whether they are complying with the Bus Body Code or not. However, the new mandate from the Road Transport Ministry prescribes bus body builders to get certification from government agencies such as ARAI and ICAT. The updated Bus Body Code also specifies guidelines for location of emergency exits, spacing between the seats, electric wiring, structure vibrations, braking performance and vehicle stability function that need to be complied with.What are the ‘indirect vision’ devices:Bus drivers often do not get the full vision of what’s behind their vehicles or in their blindspots. ‘Indirect vision’ devices or more simply, camera systems and digital monitors that help mitigate this problem. They can be compared to Level 1 ADAS safety systems that we see in modern cars such as the Blind Spot Detection systems. Cameras placed on the blind spots and at the rear, can project a clear and real-time video feed of what’s happening onto displays placed in front of the driver. This makes the buses, passengers and commuters on the road safer.

       " \" and Meta are two of the biggest, if not only, players in the mixed-reality segment. Meta has established its presence in this domain for several years, but Apple's recent unveiling of its Vision Pro has undoubtedly made a significant impact, altering the landscape.  The two companies are already readying the next iterations of their headsets, even though their current ones are still to hit the shelves, as they plan to mainstream VR. Apple is wanting to make its headset more comfortable, notes Mark Gurman of Bloomberg in the latest edition of his newsletter Power On, while Meta is taking cues from Apple's Vision Pro for its next headset, ditching the controllers to make Quest a little more affordable. Gurman writes that Apple is confident that the Vision Pro is superior. However, there are concerns over whether consumers will see the need for the device, given its high price of $3,500.  Meta, on the other hand, believes that the Quest 3's gaming ecosystem and $500 price tag make it a more appealing option. While it's difficult to bet against Apple, Meta can adjust its features based on what Apple adds to the Vision Pro and how customers respond to the technology. But Vision Pro has caused some turmoil inside Meta.  Meta is afraid of Apple, according to an insider. “We’re in the ‘afraid of Apple’ stage,” told the person, much like how the mobile industry was before the   launch. Zuckerberg shifting Quest’s focus from the metaverse to gaming and productivity, is the direct response to Apple's Vision Pro, which is what even Apple is doing. Meta is developing a cheaper, more comfortable headset called Ventura. They plan to remove bundled controllers, allowing users to use hand gestures or buy controllers separately. Meanwhile, Apple aims for a lighter and smaller successor to the Vision Pro, which even comes with built-in prescribed lenses. That’s not it; Headsets are the beginning of this segment, and glasses are to be the next big thing, at least that's what Meta hopes for. Even though Apple stopped work on AR glasses a year ago, Meta still sees them as its holy grail and plans to release AR display glasses in 2025.

       " \"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das recently proposed the introduction of card-on-file tokenisation (CoFT) facility at the issuer-bank level. He cited the growing acceptance and benefits of tokenisation of card data while announcing the proposal. For those unaware, RBI introduced new channels for card on file for tokenisation. This means that credit/debit card users will be able to generate card tokens on their bank’s website or app instead of e-commerce websites/apps while shopping online, as is the case at present. This will eliminate data security concerns regarding token generation at e-commerce or merchant portals. The move also aims to give customers greater control over managing their card tokens. What the RBI announcement means To recall, RBI introduced Card-on-File Tokenisation (CoFT) in September 2021 and began implementation from October 1, 2022. So far, over 56 crore tokens are reported to have been created on which transactions with value of over Rs 5 lakh crore have been undertaken. Tokenisation is also said to have improved transaction security and transaction approval rate.  Until now, the cardholders had to create different tokens through each merchant’s application or webpage. This would require time and effort from the users. Going forward, tokens will be created at the issuer bank level and linked to their existing accounts with various e-commerce applications. This will eliminate the duplication of tokenisation process at each app or website along with increased transaction security, resulting in reduced card-data-related frauds.  What exactly is tokenisation Tokenisation replaces a debit or credit card’s 16-digit number with a unique token that is specific to user's card and specific for one merchant at a time. The token hides the true details of your card, so that in case a data leak happens from the merchant website, the hackers cannot misuse the card. This token contains no personal information and keeps changing. Tokens can be used for online transactions, mobile point-of-sale transactions, or in-app transactions. A customer can choose whether or not to let his, her card tokenised. Tokenization guidelines are applicable to both debit and credit card and have to be tokenized for future online purchase as opted by customers.

       " 'Some industry bodies have countered telecom companies demands to regulate OTTs and charge them ‘fair share’ by submitting counter comments on the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) consultation paper on the regulatory framework for OTT communication services and the selective banning of OTT services. For clarity, the recent proposal from TRAI on selective banning of OTT or internet services has resulted in a fierce debate among the industry bodies, internet companies and startup founders. The Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) said the majority of ‘OTT services’, are in addition to, and not in derogation or substitution of, traditional telecommunications (or broadcasting) services. \"OTTs provide bundled services that cannot be separated into ‘OTT Communication Services,’ ‘OTT Broadcasting services,’ etc., making defining OTT overall or subsets of OTT for regulatory purposes near impossible,” ITI said in a statement. However, the functions of these OTT services are already regulated under the IT Act 2000. Broadband India Forum (BIF) said that the demand for network usage fees from OTTs by telecom operators is outdated and would violate net neutrality principles. “Overregulation of the OTTs would be counterproductive, as this will lead to a higher cost to customers and reduce consumer choice. Besides, it would also adversely impact innovation, lead to discrimination, adversely impact smaller entities and startups, and lead to a violation of Net Neutrality guidelines,” said T.V. Ramachandran, BIF President. The Alliance of Digital India Foundation (ADIF), a policy think tank for digital startups, said that calls for revenue-sharing arrangements between telecom service providers (TSPs) and OTT applications are primarily grounded in the misperception that OTTs are benefiting without making any contributions. “The proposed implementation of the suggested revenue-sharing model carries the potential to discourage the growth of digital enterprises. This model introduces a volume-based revenue-sharing system that could impede their sustained expansion,” the ADIF said in a statement. Additionally, it introduces an additional cost associated with accessing free or affordable content, and a portion of this expenditure may eventually be passed on to consumers, thereby increasing the cost of internet usage. The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) saod that robust regulatory frameworks for digital service providers already exist in India. “They are also variously required to comply with the Consumer Protection Act and Rules for consumer welfare, and the Competition Act for economic regulation. Under the IT Rules, digital service providers/OTT service providers are subject to dedicated compliance and reporting requirements. Therefore, the introduction of a telecom regulatory regime for OTT services would undoubtedly qualify as an act of over-regulation,” the IAMAI argued.

This long secure length is said to be the highest achieved so far, not only in India but globally, for the Differential Phase Shift (DPS) QKD protocol, according to officials. \"Such low quantum bit error rate (QBER) makes the quantum communication resistance to collective and individual attacks and implementable for various applications, such as securing financial transactions, medical records and secret codes,\" said Bhaskar Kanseri, lead researcher and associate professor at IIT-Delhi\\'s Physics Department and Optics and Photonics Centre. \"It is also capable of securing network communication such as Internet of Things (IoT) and ready to revolutionise the field of cyber security,\" Kanseri said.

The network gear maker, and one of the early adopters of artificial intelligence (AI), reported $1.43 billion in revenue in Q2, up by 13% year-over-year and up 4% on a sequential basis. Its cloud business slumped 6% year-over-year in the second quarter while the service provider business grew marginally at 1% year-over-year. The company’s chief executive Rami Rahim in the second quarter earnings call said, “I remain extremely encouraged by the momentum we\\'re seeing in our enterprise business, which delivered record revenue results and accounted for more than 45% of our total revenue, representing both our largest and fastest growing vertical for a third consecutive quarter.” “....given the digestion of prior purchases, and the uncertain timing of customer deployments, particularly amongst some of our larger cloud customers, we have less visibility, and our revenue results are likely to be pressured over the next few quarters. Based on these dynamics, we are reducing our full year revenue growth forecast. We remain committed to delivering improved profitability and still expect to deliver greater than 100 basis points of operating margin improvement in 2023,” Rahim had said.

       " \"Over the past few years,   has been working on making Android devices and accessories work better together. The tech giant may soon introduce “Device Groups” to offer better compatibility within the Android ecosystem. Among other features, Device Groups will allow Android devices to transfer video calls between devices. Lately, the company has introduced multiple Android features that aim to help users by linking their devices together. Earlier, Google introduced a cross-device feature that allowed users to move voice calls between devices. Now, the company may soon allow Android users to transfer video calls as well.  What is Device Groups and how will it work A blog post by TheSpAndroid (spotted by 9to5Google) claims that Google is moving away from “Link your devices'' phrasing for this feature and will instead call it “Device Groups.” This feature will enable users to add devices to a group that are linked to their Google account during setup, or invite them later on. The report has also shared the screenshot of a pop-up that will appear ahead of initial setup. This pop-up will bring out two use cases. One of them is the ability to transfer an active video call between devices. In the image, Google explains how this feature will work. The company claims:: “See ongoing video calls from other devices and seamlessly move them here.” The report couldn’t explain how the feature will look like in action, but it may work on an app-by-app basis using the cross-device SDK that Google has detailed on Android’s developer site. Google Meet is expected to be the first platform to support Device Groups. The pop-up will also offer another use case which will be the ability to “share internet access when your other devices are offline.” With this feature, users will be able to enable or disable hotspots on another device in the group. The report also didn’t mention when Google is planning to release this functionality for Android users. However, the company is expected to make these features available soon.

Starting today, users in the UK and Australia can access over 150,000 audiobooks without additional cost, which will be available for subscribers in the US later this year. While users can choose to listen to as many audiobooks as they want out of the vast collection of more than 150,000 titles, they will be limited to 15 hours of free listening time. If users wish to listen more, they will need to purchase additional hours at a rate of 10 hours for $11. As of now, this is exclusively available to individual Premium subscribers and Family or Duo accounts' plan managers. However, Spotify plans to expand its availability in the future. Those not subscribed to Premium or the ones who are subscribed can still purchase any title they want from Spotify's audiobook library without having to pay for additional hours if they have specific books in mind.  “Audiobooks today have one big dominating player. And just like in music and podcasting, we believe that many more consumers want to consume audiobooks and want to listen to audiobooks,” said Spotify founder and CEO Daniel Ek, speaking at the event hosted in the company's New York offices on Tuesday. “And just like in music and podcasting, we’re really excited to be able to bring all the amazing tools that we built for creators and consumers alike to enable more discovery of these amazing audiobooks to the entire world.”  There is an auto-bookmarking tool that will save users time from having to repeat pages. Then, users can activate the Spotify Sleep Timer which will allow users to fall asleep while listening to their books without having to rewind when they wake up. And subscribers can download audiobooks for offline listening. Alex Norstrom, the co-president and chief business officer of Spotify, said there are already tens of millions of Premium subscribers who are interested in listening to audiobooks, but they lack the opportunity.

The BJP has 67 of the remaining 94 constituencies. The CEC could drop 25 to 30 of the BJP MLAs because surveys have found that people in their constituencies are not happy with their work, say sources.\"The party feels that nearly half of these incumbent legislators will not be able to win their seats. New faces may be given tickets,\" a senior BJP leader explained.In the fourth list, announced on Monday, most ministers of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government were fielded from their respective constituencies. Budhni: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan appears to be fighting a lone battle these days. And most of the 2.7 lakh voters of his constituency, Budhni, aren\\'t happy about it. They feel their Mama is being sidelined by the party leadership, and are seething.Chouhan has bared his heart before them in recent days, saying they will \"miss him\", and asking them if he should become chief minister again. As Chouhan faces the toughest challenge of his political career, his supporters in Budhni are bristling at what they see as his neglect by the party.Budhni, around 70km from Bhopal on the banks of Narmada, has elected Chouhan five times to the assembly. Since 2006, people of Budhni are known as Shivraj\\'s own. It\\'s been the CM\\'s constituency for 17 years and comes with its perks and pride.But with the BJP not declaring Chouhan the party\\'s CM face this time, the voters of Budhni are angry and even threatening an agitation. When TOI visited Budhni on Wednesday, people\\'s angst was palpable, while they clung to hope that he would make a comeback. \"I want to see Mama as CM. Otherwise we will sit on dharna,\" said an agitated Ajay Manjhi from Jhanda Chowk area.Chouhan\\'s name wasn\\'t on the first three lists, leading to murmurs in his camp. On September 22, it was Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who led BJP\\'s Jan Ashirwad Yatra into Budhni, Chouhan\\'s son Kartikeya at his side. Chouhan wasn\\'t there.After the second list was released on September 26 and seven heavyweights, including three Union ministers, were fielded, it was clear that the BJP central leadership was propping up multiple potential CM faces to counter anti-incumbency.Four days after that, on October 1, Chouhan was in Budhni\\'s Ladkui when he said: \"Aisa bhaiyya nahin milega. Jab mein chala jaunga, tab bahut yaad aaunga (You will not get a brother like me. When I go away, you will remember me a lot).\"Two days later, he asked voters: \"Should I contest the election or not? Should Mama become chief minister or not?\" The crowd shouted, \"Yes,\" and started chanting, \"Mama, Mama\".And on October 6, in Ujjain, he asked for the blessings of sadhus, saying, \"Guide me. Political roads are filled with turmoil. There is a threat that one can slip at every step. Sometimes, there arise many who put you in a \\'chakkar\\'.\"Chouhan\\'s statements in the past few days have given enough hints that he\\'s not happy with the way he is being treated despite being the longest serving CM of BJP from 2005 to 2023, barring 15 months Congress rule.

It\\'s a question BJP will find hard to ignore.\"Ma Narmada\\'s blessings will decide who will be the CM. Wait for the right time,\" says priest Gopiram at Narmada Ghat in Budhni.The people of his constituency have seen Chouhan rise in political stature where they see him today as the \"champion of MP politics\".

       " 'NEW DELHI: The upcoming assembly elections in the key states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh may pose a challenge to the unity of INDIA (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) - a coalition of opposition parties formed to take on the ruling BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.As the Congress gears up for a direct contest with the BJP in the three Hindi heartland states, which the grand old party won five years back in 2018, it will have to contend with the presence of Aam Aadmi Party - which recently got the status of a national party and is determined to expand its base. The Congress and the AAP are allies in the anti-BJP front. However, as political rivals in several states the two parties share an uneasy relation.Assembly elections in Mizoram, Chhattisgarh, MP, Rajasthan and Telangana: Watch the complete scheduleFor the Congress, victory in these states will give the party an edge and also greater bargaining power in the opposition space. The Congress has government in four states as of now - Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, while the AAP is in power in two states - Delhi and Punjab.Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have traditionally seen a direct contest between the BJP and the Congress. In Chhattisgarh, however, some tribal-based regional parties have strong pockets of influence impacting the prospects of the two main contenders.Arvind Kejriwal has already announced that AAP will contest in all the three states. Soon after the Election Commission announced the poll schedule, Kejriwal said, \"We are prepared to contest the elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh with full strength.\"In fact, AAP leaders including Kejriwal have gone all out to target the Congress governments in the two poll-bound states. In Chhattisgarh, Kejriwal slammed the condition of government schools under the Congress rule and cited the success of his Delhi model. The AAP has also announced 10 \"guarantees\" which included Rs 3,000 monthly allowance for the unemployed, a monthly \"samman rashi\" assistance for women, free electricity, free school education, mohalla clinics.In the 2018 assembly polls, the AAP had fielded 85 candidates in Chhattisgarh. However, all of them ended up losing their deposits. In Rajasthan also, Kejriwal has promised several guarantees and sought votes to make a new Rajasthan - free of corruption. Kejriwal attacked Congress chief minister Ashok Gehlot for not taking any action against BJP\\'s Vasundhara Raje over corruption charges.“Their leader Sachin Pilot got tired of raising the issue, demanding action but Gehlot did nothing. If you want politics of friendship then vote for them (Congress-BJP) but if want politics of patriotism then vote for AAP,” he said.AAP leaders have been campaigning aggressively with poll guarantees in Madhya Pradesh also as they try to create space for the party in the poll-bound state. Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann, in one of his rallies, urged the people of Madhya Pradesh not to vote for the BJP or the Congress, alleging that they have entered into a deal to loot the public for five years each. The AAP is focusing on the Vindhya region of the state as it has won the Singrauli\\'s mayoral post in the last local bodies elections and cornered a sizable number of votes in the region. Before the announcement of the assembly poll dates, both Kejriwal and Mann have addressed meetings in the Vindhya region.The Congress leaders have reacted sharply to AAP attacks in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. However, the top party leadership has evaded any direct comments on the issue. It is still not clear if the two parties will enter into an alliance for the state polls. When asked if AAP will contest assembly elections as part of the INDIA bloc, Kejriwal said \"whatever happens will be apprised\".Perhaps, the aggressive AAP foray in the three states where the Congress has huge stakes could be a pressure tactic to ensure that the grand old party agrees to recognise AAP as the dominant force in Delhi and Punjab.However, if the alliance talks fail and AAP contests alone, it will be interesting to see which of the two main players - the BJP or the Congress - is impacted more.',\n",

Many of the deceased were sole earners of the family. The government machinery has failed to stop illegal operations of the liquor mafia.\"Threat of starvation is looming over families of those killed in the hooch tragedy. On the top of that, the chief minister of state is saying \\'Jo Piyega Wo Marega\\'. The state government refused to give compensation to the dependents of the victims. What is the fault of the families which lost their breadwinners.\"Anand said: \"The state government is claiming that only 42 deaths occurred due to hooch, which means that the authorities have conducted post-mortem examinations of only 42 bodies. The local villages claimed over 200 persons lost their lives in the tragedy and were cremated near railway lines, adjoining to roads and other places as they were allegedly pressurised by local police.\"What happened to those victims who were not recognised by the state government? Many of the victims did not have the money to cremate the bodies. The state government, which used to provide Rs 3,000 to the families who could not afford cremation of the bodies under Kabir Antesthi Yojana, did not even gave that to the families of hooch tragedy victims.\"The Nitish Kumar government is hiding the numbers. It is a clear violation of human rights and hence NHRC is investigating the incident to find out the actual numbers of deceased,\" he said.\"CM Nitish Kumar, Tejashwi Yadav and other leaders of grand alliance are alleging that why NHRC team did not go to Gujarat, MP, Haryana and Karnataka? Comparing hooch tragedies in other states with the one in Bihar is not justified. The Bihar government should accept its failure.\"Sources said that NHRC teams have prepared the list of deceased who were sole bread earners of their respective families, their financial status, number of children who lost their fathers and now reached a stage of starvation.Abhishek Jha, the national spokesperson of JD(U) told IANS: \"NHRC has a basic principle to protect human right violation in the country. In Bihar, there is no such violation of human rights. Hence, its investigation is not needed here.\"\"BJP in the last eight years has used constitutional bodies for its vested interest. Why has it not gone in other states where massive tragedies had happened in the past. It is an effort to build an atmosphere against the grand alliance government in Bihar and prepare a ground for future elections,\" Jha said.RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari told IANS: \"Everyone knows how the BJP misuses constitutional institutions for its political interests. The Narendra Modi government has been using CBI, ED, Income tax and other authorities to target political opponents.\"The NHRC investigation is underway on the same line to defame the Bihar government. It could be a bigger plan to declare that human right violation is taking place at a big scale and plan a roadmap for imposing the President\\'s Rule in the state.\"Jagadanand Singh, the state president of RJD, told IANS that he will comment on the issue only after the NHRC\\'s report appears in public domain.The Nitish Kumar government is firm on not giving the compensations to those who violated the liquor prohibition norms.In what appears to be an image building effort, for the last couple of days, Tejashwi Yadav can be seen distributing blankets to people in night shelters or those sleeping on roads.As two teams of NHRC are investigating in Saran, the state government is also on the toes and trying to establish the substances used in the manufacturing of liquor.\"During investigation, we have detected that a certain type of chemical was used in making of liquor. Our investigating teams have collected the samples and it will be matched with the chemical found in the viscera reports of deceased. Then we can reach a conclusion that the liquor got poisonous due to that chemical,\" said Jitendra Singh Gangwar, ADGP headquarters.\"We have arrested 153 persons who were involved in either liquor manufacturing or selling it in the district,\" he said.',\n",

Shah also had lunch at the Palace. Later, he reached the mela ground to lay the foundation stone of a new terminal at Gwalior airport, which is to be named after Scindia\\'s grandmother and (late) Madhavrao Scindia\\'s mother Vijayaraje Scindia.The new terminal building will be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 446 crore.

After the expansion, the airport will have the capacity to park 13 planes as against the existing capacity for three aircraft, an official told IANS.While addressing the gathering, Shah said, \"Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia Airport in Gwalior is one of the most modern airports with the latest facilities. With the dedication with which this airport has been carefully planned, I think it will be one of the best airports in the country.

Secondly, it was an indirect reply to those (Congress leaders) who were saying that Scindia would not get as much respect in the BJP as he used to get in the Congress,\" said a political observer in Madhya Pradesh.Another political analyst claimed that inviting Shah to his hometown, Scindia has played to masterstroke to give an apt reply to his old political opponents, especially within the Madhya Pradesh BJP unit. \"Defeat in the Lok Sabha election from his family bastion -- Guna was a major setback for Jyotiraditya Scindia. After he joined the BJP, he received another setback when the BJP lost the mayoral seat in Gwalior against the Congress. Now, when the state Assembly elections are just a few months away, and Scindia\\'s name is already doing rounds for the leadership in Madhya Pradesh, this visit of Shah will give an extra edge to him,\" political analysts said.Scindia was personally monitoring the preparations for the event in Gwalior for the last few days. The BJP leaders, who are considered Scindia\\'s loyalists and are the ministers in Shivraj Singh Chouhan\\'s cabinet, were assigned specific roles for this event.

Modi underlined that it would create new opportunities for employment and self-employment in the country.\"Today, the whole world is of the belief that this century is going to be India\\'s century,\" the prime minister said as he credited the young population of India for this.The prime minister observed that when the elderly population is increasing in many countries of the world, India is getting younger with each passing day.\"India has this huge advantage,\" he stressed as he noted the world is looking towards India for its skilled youth.The prime minister suggested not to waste any opportunity being created and assured that the government is ready to support the cause.Modi highlighted the importance of the power of the youth in utilizing the strengths of any country such as its natural or mineral resources, or its long coastlines and said that the country develops more with stronger youth power thereby doing justice to the nation\\'s resources.Today, the prime minister emphasized that a similar thinking is empowering India\\'s youth, which is making unprecedented improvements in the entire ecosystem.\"In this, the country\\'s approach is two-pronged,\" the prime minister said.He explained that India is preparing its youth to take advantage of new opportunities through skilling and education as he highlighted the new National Education Policy which has been established after almost 4 decades.The prime minister also underlined that the government is establishing a large number of new medical colleges and skill development institutes like IITs, IIMs or ITIs, and mentioned the crores of youth who have been trained under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana.On the other hand, he stated that traditional sectors which provide jobs are being strengthened while new sectors that promote employment and entrepreneurship are also being promoted.The prime minister also mentioned India making new records in goods exports, mobile exports, electronic exports, services exports, defence exports and manufacturing, and at the same time creating a large number of new opportunities for youth in many sectors such as space, startups, drones, animation, electric vehicles, semiconductors, etc.Modi informed that India\\'s proposal regarding global skill mapping has been recently accepted at the G20 Summit, which will help in creating better opportunities for youth in the coming times.India\\'s unemployment rate for persons aged 15 years and above was recorded at a six-year low of 3.2 per cent during July 2022-June 2023, as per the Periodic Labour Force Survey Annual Report 2022-2023 released by the National Sample Survey Office this week.Joblessness or unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of unemployed persons in the labour force.Considering the importance of the availability of labour force data at more frequent time intervals, the NSSO launched the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) in April 2017.

       " 'Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday demanded a caste census to ensure \"justice\" with OBCs, SCs, and STs and slammed the ruling BJP in Madhya Pradesh, saying 250 scams have taken place during its 18 years in power. \"Recently Bihar has conducted a caste census and it was revealed that 84 per cent of the people belong to OBC (Other Backward Class), SC (Scheduled Caste), and ST (Schedule Tribe) categories in the state. But their numbers in jobs are very low. To know their exact numbers and to do justice with them, a caste census should be conducted in the country,\" she said. The Congress leader was addressing a public meeting in Mandla district ahead of the November 17 assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh. Besides announcing a slew of promises, including implementation of the Old Pension Scheme (OPS), Gandhi also declared that her party, if voted to power in MP, will provide not only free education to students from Std I to Std XII, but also give Rs 500 per month to students from Std I to Std VIII, Rs 1,000 a month to those in Std IX and Std X and 1,500 for Std XI and Std XII. During its 18 years of rule in the state, Gandhi said, the BJP has done nothing for the people. It remembers them only during elections by announcing a slew of schemes for them, she said. HP Governor warns against society division amid caste census debateThe Congress leader alleged that \"250 scams, including Vyapam, mid-day meal, and scholarship\" took place in the state which has been governed by the BJP for nearly 225 months. Invoking former prime minister and her grandmother Indira Gandhi, the Congress leader said she somewhat resembles her and therefore, she has to be more \"responsible for the people, especially the tribal population\". Gandhi said the Congress would implement a host of promises after \"coming to power in MP\". She also listed out some of them: implementation of OPS, gas cylinder for Rs 500, monthly dole of Rs 1,500 to women, loan waiver scheme, free 100 units of power per connection and 200 units at half price, free electricity to farmers for running up to 5 HP motors for agriculture, and a caste census.',\n",

In a freewheeling interview with ETimes recently, he spoke about coming from a family of music lovers, dealing with campismin the industry, his thoughts on music down South and more.Read Also\\'Kailash Kher is a dynamite when he takes over the microphone,\\' says music composer Pranaay - ExclusivePranaay, the music composer known for his work in the \"Baaghi\" series, recently showcased his Indian classical skills in the song \"Ho Tayyar\" from \"OMG 2\". In an interview, Pranaay expressed his gratitude for being part of a successful film with an important message. He also discussed the process ofDivya Kumar: Music Mafia seems like a scary word, but they do exist - ExclusiveSinger Divya Kumar exclusively told ETimes about his thoughts on the remix culture in Bollywood, music mafias, his bond with Amit Trivedi and Varun Dhawan, and more.Excerpts...Many people in the past have spoken about the music mafia in the industry. Have you ever experienced it in your career so far?I think music mafia is a very strong word and it\\'s not really like that. However, whether it\\'s the corporate world or the film world, there is campism, and even I suffered because of it. Also because I didn\\'t really want to do remakes of other songs, and I wanted to stick with the original music, which was not really the flavor of the season, and I\\'m glad that it\\'s getting over and people are now ready to accept original music.Not many people know that you started your career with \\'Raaz 2\\'. Tell us something about it.Getting \\'Raaz 2\\' is an exciting story itself. I used to teach guitar to students all over Mumbai to survive as a musician before I made it into Bollywood. And once I was travelling in the train, I got a call stating that Mukesh Bhatt and Mohit Suri, who wanted to meet me for a song. They asked me to get my guitar. I didn\\'t have my guitar with me at that time so I called my mother and I asked her to please get it at the railway station. So she very excitedly got the guitar and blessed me. And I took the guitar, went back to their office and I played my heart out. Bhat Sahab just looked at me, stared into my eyes and he said, \\'Okay, your song is selected. Come and shake my hand\\'. I shook his hand, he looked at me and he asked, Who will be the first person that you tell this news to? Your girlfriend or your mother?\\' I just laughed and I said, \\'Sir, I\\'ll tell my mother first\\'.You don\\'t come from a family with a musical background. How and when did the music bug bite you?I don\\'t come from a family of musicians, but I do come from a family of music lovers. My grandfather was a great KL Sehgal fan. And while growing up, I used to sing in the school choir. And I was probably the only non-Catholic child who would sing in the choir. And then, once I was in college, I started learning music formally. I learnt guitar from Mr Bismarck Roderick, piano from Mrs Maureen Rebello, and Indian classical from Shri Rajan Santramji. And that\\'s how my journey began.What are your opinions about music in Bollywood and music down South?I think the music in all industries is very unique whether it\\'s Hindi film industry or down South. Even in the South, the Malayalam music industry is very different and the instrumentation is very different from the Tamil and Tamil is also very different from Telugu and Kannada also has a very rich heritage so I think that when you compare industries you also have to see what is the foundation of music. Where we primarily do Hindustani classical, down South it used to be a Carnatic classical but now everything is mixed and everyone takes inspiration from all around the world, not only in India so I think it\\'s a very exciting time that we are now. The boundaries have ceased.Name one latest composition (apart from your own) that you absolutely loved in recent times.One song that really stood out for me in recent times was a song called \\'Ro Lain De\\' from the film \\'Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani\\'. It was beautifully composed by Pritam, lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya and it was so refreshing to hear Sonu Nigam\\'s voice. I mean, it is just ethereal the way he has sung it. And that\\'s one song that just came like a surprise in the film and it was such a beautiful, soulful number.Who did you grow up listening to? Is there anyone you look up to in the music industry?As a music composer, when I look back at my journey on what were my influences, I now realise that they were so varied. I used to listen to KL Saigal, SD Burman, RD Burman from the film music. And I would listen to Indian classical with Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, and also 90s was a very vibrant era, so we were also exposed to the Michael Jacksons and you know the Backstreet Boys and pop. And so I think I would say pop, rock, Indian classical, film music, it\\'s just an amalgamation of everything and that\\'s what I think has led me to experiment with so many different genres.What\\'s next?Next up is my own label Thriver Entertainment. We\\'re releasing two Tamil songs. It\\'s written by the brilliant Tamil lyricist Madan Karki and then I have many Hindi songs that I have composed that are going to be released independently. So I want to create a music label where it\\'s known for good original music, you know. No remakes, we promise!',\n",

One such controversy that is making headlines currently is related to singer Shubh and his canceled India Music Tour. It was an event that promised to be a grand celebration of music but ended up mired in controversy.It all started in March when Shubh shared a distorted map of India on his Instagram story. In the post, the map didn’t have regions like Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir. Accompanying the image was a caption that read, \"Pray for Punjab.\" This swiftly sparked criticism and allegations of tacitly supporting the Khalistani movement.He started getting backlash from different corners, and as it gained momentum, Shubh later removed the map from his Instagram story. In its place, he posted a simpler message that solely stated, \"Pray for Punjab,\" devoid of any accompanying visual element. While this alteration might have been an attempt at damage control, the initial post had already ignited significant scrutiny and raised questions about his stance regarding the Khalistan issue, leading to many issues, one being the cancellation of Shubh’s India Music Tour. Initially, Shubh didn’t react. His sponsors backed away, leading cricketers of India unfollwed him on social media, and he received a lot of flake. Finally, the artist has broken his silence over the matter. Taking to his social media story he wrote that as a young artist from Punjab, it was his dream to pin his music on the global map. However, the recent events have left him in a state of grief and he wishes to express himself.He confessed to being excited about the whole tour, and talked about the preparation, but unfortunately, fate had other plans. He further quoted that India is his country too, as he was born here. He expressed that he is proud to be a Punjabi and whatever he is today, he owes that to his land.Check out Shubh’s post on the India Tour controversy here:On the one hand, where a segment of the internet and many other people stood against Shubh, many artists from the Punjabi entertainment world showed their support for the artist.Sidhu Moose Wala’s team posted a story on the late singer’s official handle.

At that time the indie music scene was in its infancy. Since then Ashu, Kailash and myself have had incredible careers. We have all matured as musicians yet we all still possess the childlike enthusiasm of our younger selves. The song speaks of the innocence of that period of our lives when we were starting out. It was also the period when we were setting up Blue Frog and that Summer of breaking out into the world. So you could say that Summertime Rocks is a coming-of-age song that speaks from the heart!\"Describing his working experience while creating the music video with Ashu and Kailesh, he says, \"Summertime Rocks was composed and written in a day or so, I believe. Like all creative processes, someone has to always be ready to record the ideas as they happen! That was my responsibility. Ashu came up with the line Summertime Rocks and we started jamming on the idea. Midway through the verse, we felt the song needed another voice. We used to jam very often with Kailash in those days, so we called him, and he was in the studio the same afternoon. Within a few minutes, he came up with the first line: “Har pal jaata hai zindagi say, toh qyun na jeele khushi say…”, which was the perfect “sawaal” to set up the line: “Cos it\\'s the Summertime and its Rocks.”Talking about the whole idea behind Wah Wah Records, he mentioned, \"Wah Wah Records (WWR) is a culmination of my two-decade-long journey in the music business. I have produced music across various mediums- Films, theatre, advertising, documentaries, TV, Web Series and also my own music. Along the way, I have also co-founded blueFrog, performed and toured all over the world. It’s been an incredible journey and now it\\'s time to give back to the music fraternity that I have been a part of. We start out with Smoke Signals, then follow up with White Noise - an OST soundtrack that I also co-produced with Ashu. Mumbai Star - is the next one - a Bollywood-style musical that is touring Japan in November and December.\"When quizzed about how he strikes a balance between composing for a film and independent music, Dhruv stated, \"Whenever you are called to produce music for a film, there are various forces at play. You must navigate the director\\'s vision, the producer\\'s commercial concerns, and the lead actor\\'s preferences on voice while infusing your own perspective. Experience helps, but it\\'s important to retain the irreverence and spontaneity of youth. Creating your own music offers more freedom, but you must wear all the hats: CEO, CFO, marketing manager, etc. The responsibilities are multifold, but I\\'ve learned to compartmentalize and wake up early to get everything done.\"',\n",

       " 'Who can forget the winter of 1961? It was an unforgettable for Indian cinema. Two of its brightest stars, Uttam Kumar from Bengal and Shammi Kapoor from Bombay (now Mumbai), came together for the premiere of Kapoor\\'s film, ‘Junglee’, at Roxy Cinema in Kolkata. Uttam Kumar was wearing a dazzling diamond ring, a special gift from Kapoor who held immense admiration for the Bengali cine legend. Read AlsoBlast from the past: When Uttam Kumar said ‘NO’ to Raj Kapoor\\'s ‘Jagte Rahow’ and ‘Sangam’In 1967, Uttam Kumar finally made his Hindi debut in the film ‘Chotisi Mulaqaat’ opposite Vyjayanthimala. It was a remake of his Bengali cult classic ‘Agni Pareeksha’. However, the Hindi adaptation didn\\'t impress the audience. As the reel rolled, Uttam Kumar was utterly captivated by Shammi Kapoor\\'s enigmatic sense of rhythm and acting prowess. The camaraderie was palpable, and the two stars hugged each other warmly after the show, a mutual admiration society in full view.  Shammi Kapoor, who was a revolutionary figure in the Indian film industry during the \\'60s, was a devoted admirer of Uttam Kumar. His trips to Kolkata were never considered complete without watching Uttam Kumar\\'s latest films or meeting the actor in person. However, when Uttam Kumar’s Hindi film ‘Choti Si Mulakat’ failed to impress the audiences, Kapoor voiced his concerns candidly. He felt that Uttam Kumar should have never attempted to fill his shoes, advising that he was best suited for Bengali classics. According to Kapoor, Hindi cinema could not possibly do justice to the exceptional talent that was Uttam Kumar.  Uttam Kumar, revered as Bengal’s king of hearts, ambitiously ventured into Bombay’s film industry with \"Chhoti Si Mulaqat\" in 1967. Produced under his own banner, \\'Our Movies,\\' and with his brother Tarun Kumar serving as the executive producer, the film had a lot riding on it. It was based on a revered story by Ashapurna Devi, titled ‘Agni Pariksha’, and was essentially a remake of a 1954 film of the same name. That earlier film had cemented Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen as the quintessential romantic pair in Bengali cinema. For the 1967 venture, the screenplay was penned by Sachin Bhowmick and the dialogues by Abrar Alvi, under the direction of Alo Sirkar and cinematography by Kanai Dey. The music was scored by the legendary Shankar Jaikishan, and featured lyrics by Hasrat Jaipuri and Shailendra. With playback by iconic singers like Rafi, Lata Mangeshkar, Suman Kalyanpur, and Asha Bhosle, it was no surprise that the film’s music became a hit. Uttam Kumar was paired with Vyjayanthimala, a leading actress of that era, and was supported by an impressive ensemble cast, including Shashikala, Rajendra Nath, and Tarun Bose.  However, the film failed to resonate with audiences outside Bengal, which was a crushing disappointment. There’s been speculation that had Uttam Kumar opted for a Bombay-based director, perhaps someone like Shakti Samanta, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Asit Sen, or even Pramod Chakravorty, the film might have fared differently.',\n",

The producers requested Shemaroo who agreed because of Ajay's goodwill and they also had to pay a reduced amount to purchase the movie.\",\n",

       " 'Ludhiana: Apart from lodging six FIRs against a “fraud” travel agent, who was arrested by crime investigation agency (CIA) II on August 31, the police are probing 30 more complaints received against him, among which 10 are from the police personnel of different ranks. The CIA-II arrested Chirag Kapoor (33) of Gori Apartment in Chander Nager, who was wanted in five cases of fraud. The police had also recovered 20 passports, an SUV, and some documents from his possession. During the interrogation, the police found that the accused is still trying to convince the complainants to not lodge an FIR against him and rather give him time to arrange the visa or money.Inspector Beant Juneja, in-charge CIA-II, said earlier, Kapoor only had a ticketing licence. “He had links with agents and through them, he sent many people abroad. However, when lockdown was imposed due to Covid-19 and the processing of all visa-related files were stopped, he could not arrange visas for people from who he had taken money. Some of them then filed complaints against him. But one thing is sure that he never had a license required for sending people abroad,” he added.“We have at least 30 more complaints pending against him, which are being verified as according to Kapoor, those files are still in process. Some complainants, who are cops, visited us to meet Chirag. They wanted cases to be registered against him, however, Chirag convinced them to wait for some time. At first, the police will verify the fact and only then more cases may be registered against him,” the cop said.On asking how Kapoor got so many cops to fall into prey, Juneja said initially, Chirag had got some cops and their kins visas. His name was spread through word of mouth and therefore people, including police officials, approached him to get visas. ',\n",
       " 'BENGALURU: Much like other civic agencies that seldom stick to project deadlines, the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) too has been dragging its feet on executing work on a crucial project that will reduce distance between east Bengaluru and Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) and take the pressure off inner city roads.In 2020, the state government entrusted the agency with the task of constructing an alternative road to KIA from Budigere-Hoskote Cross Road, the aim being to decongesting city roads. Designed for vehicles to move at 80-100 kmph speed, the project was to benefit people living in Whitefield, KR Pura, Hoskote and eastern parts of Bengaluru.It has been over three years now but the agency is still buying time to complete the project. The total length of the four-lane road is 20km. The project cost was estimated at Rs 254 crore.MD of KRDCL, Lingamurthy G, blamed delay in land acquisition, shifting of utilities and clearance from the forest department for the tardy progress. Incomplete construction work on several stretches is only causing hardship to motorists. Chandrashekar Gowda, a taxi driver who often uses the road, said: “At present, people commuting from Whitefield and eastern parts of the city take the congested Outer Ring Road (ORR) stretch to reach the airport. Traffic gridlocks at Tin Factory, Kasturi Nagar, Nagawara and Hebbal make them very anxious about making it on time. Had the authorities completed this road, they could have avoided busy roads in city limits.” Manjunath Prasad, a resident of Budigere, said: “After the state government announced this project, a lot of residential projects and commercial establishments have come up in the area. Early completion of the road project will provide relief to not just those travelling to the airport, but also benefit villagers.” Prasad highlighted how lack of streetlights on the road posed risk for motorists at night. The alignment of the road starts from Hoskote-Budigere Cross and goes via Budigere-Singahalli Road and Mylanahalli. After Mylanahalli, the alignment gets integrated with the existing road located on the southern side of the airport. Air passengers will be able to reach KIA via the existing alternative road from Begur junction (Galamma Circle). Once the road is developed, the airport will be about 36km from Whitefield, 34from KR Pura and and 30km from Hoskote. But taking the ORR means people from these areas don’t just travel 20km extra, but also lose a lot of time at the busy junctions. ',\n",
       " \"Raipur: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and senior Congress leaders from state will travel on a train to reach Bilaspur’s Takhatpur for a public event on Monday. The former Congress president is all set to travel like an “Aam Aadmi” in the passenger or sleeper class to reach Bilaspur. Party sources said Gandhi may travel by the Raipur-Bilaspur Intercity Express from Raipur at 11:15 am on Monday and return to Raipur by the LTT Express at 5 pm on the same day. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, deputy chief minister T S Singhdeo, and Congress state president Deepak Baij may also accompany Rahul Gandhi on the occasion.According to party sources, the Congress party has also arranged an alternate mode of transport by road or by air for Rahul Gandhi to reach Takhatpur. Speaking about Rahul Gandhi’s tour to Chhattisgarh, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Sunday, however, suggested that Rahul Gandhi should opt for traveling from Raipur to Bilaspur by road, instead of his plans to travel by train, in view of the frequent cancellations of passenger trains in the state. “The way the trains are being canceled, I would suggest him to go to Bilaspur by road and return by train due to the frequent delays and cancellations,” Baghel told reporters here. Thec chief minister took a dig at the BJP, saying that the railway minister is visible only during rail accidents, while the Prime Minister grabs all the attention whenever trains need to be flagged off. Reacting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagging off nine Vande Bharat trains across 11 states on Monday, Baghel said that many trains in Chhattisgarh catering to common passengers are frequently being canceled.“The trains that are flagged off are either small or have no passengers because the journey in these trains has become very expensive. The trains that used to have a continuous flow of passengers are being canceled every now and then, and the Prime Minister does not address this issue. Moreover, the inauguration of the rail corridor by the Prime Minister is not for the passengers; it is for coal transportation,” he said.Referring to the National Family and Health Survey report, the chief minister said that 40 lakh people have moved above the poverty line, with 88% of urban people using toilets. In rural areas, 73% of people use toilets. Overall, 76% of the population uses toilets, while 23% do not.He also said that the ODF Plus status has been declared for the state. “However, 16 lakh families still do not use toilets in the state. This was declared during Raman Singh's tenure,” Baghel said, allegeding a massive scam involving around 1.5 billion rupees has occurred in the construction of toilets.“Letters have been written to the central government, but no investigation is being conducted,” he said, adding that the leaders of the BJP are silent on this issue. “This also needs to be investigated by the ED and IT departments,” he added.\",\n",
       " 'Nagpur: Over 15 crore travelers who fall in the ‘senior citizens’ category as per the Indian Railways have travelled in trains without fare concessions withdrawn during the Covid-19 pandemic.Information obtained by Amravati-based activist Ajay Bose from the Railway Board under Right to Information Act (RTI) revealed that in the last three years (April 1, 2020 to July 31, 2023) a total of 15,26,53,426 senior citizens (men above 60 and women above 58 years of age) travelled without fare concession.The Railway Board informed that in 2020-21 the number of such passengers was 1,86,16,972, while in 2021-22 it was 5,44,48,061. In 2022-23, the number of elderly passengers rose to 7,95,88,393. All the previously existing fare concessions were withdrawn during the pandemic period starting March 20, 2020. Though the pandemic has subsided, the concessions have not been restored, pointed out Bose. Lawyer Sundeep Badana too had filed a PIL in the Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court on August 3, 2022, demanding restoration of fare concessions. A bench of Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice MW Chandwani on December 14, 2022, disposed of the PIL setting a three-month deadline from the date of the order for the Railways to take a decision. The high court order said, “Now that the Covid-19 pandemic has been abated, in the changed circumstances, it was necessary for the railways to take a fresh decision in respect of continuation of the withdrawal of concessions otherwise.”The Railway Board wrote a letter to Badana on January 24, 2023, stating that the board has examined the matter and found that the government is already giving huge subsidies on passenger services. “In 2019-20, the subsidy amount was over ₹59,000 crore. This amounts to 53% on average for every person, traveling on railways. This subsidy is continuing for all passengers. Further, concessions beyond this subsidy amount are continuing for defined categories of Divyangians, patients and students,” the Board stated.The High Court had in 2022 granted liberty to Badana to approach the court, if there is a fresh cause of action arising in the matter. In response, Badana filed a fresh PIL in the matter on August 23 this year.',\n",
       " 'Mangaluru: The critical condition of a nine-month-old girl from a health centre in Banakal, Chikkamagaluru district, forced a doctor to accompany her in an ambulance for a distance of 120km, to get the girl admitted to a speciality hospital here.The girl, a resident of Banakal, experienced seizures, and was immediately taken to Sai Krishna Health Centre in Banakal. Recognizing the severity of her condition, the medical team decided to shift her to a tertiary care facility here.The health centre is affiliated with Shri Krishna Hospital, Kakkinje, in Belthangady taluk. In light of this, Dr Madan Kumar G, chief medical officer of the health centre, Banakal, coordinated with Dr Murali Krishna Irwathraya, medical director of Shri Krishna Hospital. Following their consultation, a decision was made to transfer the infant to Mangaluru for further medical care.Dr Kumar G said, “ The parents had brought the infant about seven days ago for treatment. She was suffering from cold and fever, and had no other complaints. She was fine after four days of treatment, but after a week, she started developing fever. However, on Wednesday, the parents called me and said that their daughter had a seizure at 5 pm. I told them to rush the child to the hospital. At 11 pm, the child was brought to the centre after she had a second seizure. Looking at the infant’s condition, we decided to do a blood test, and found that she was suffering from severe infection. We consulted Dr Krishna and coordinated with Dr Jayaprakash of Srinivas Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Mukka, and it was decided to shift the child to Srinivas Hospital, as she needed treatment at a paediatric intensive care unit,” he said.The other doctor at Banakal Hospital was on night duty, and hence Dr Madan decided to accompany the patient, as her condition was critical. “Without thinking twice, I got into the ambulance with the necessary medicines. Fortunately, the journey to Mangaluru was smooth. We left at 12 am, went to Shri Krishna Hospital, where the child was shifted to an ambulance with better facilities. The patient was examined by Dr Krishna before we left for Mangaluru,” said Dr Madan.Dr Krishna said, “The patient was unconscious and after examining her and administering necessary medicines, she was shifted to a more advanced facility. It is a rare case where a doctor volunteers to accompany a patient in an ambulance late at night. By the time the patient was admitted to the hospital in Mangaluru and returned, it was about 7.40 am. The commitment demonstrated by this young doctor is commendable and deserves appreciation,” he said. ',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: A passenger travelling by Delhi Metro instead of a car saves almost 32.4 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilometre. Thus, a ride from Janakpuri West metro station on Blue Line to Hindon River metro station on Red Line would save about 840 grams of CO2 emissions while a one-way metro journey from MG Road station to Samaypur Badli station would save 1,420 grams of CO2.From Thursday, QR-coded tickets - both paper- and mobile-based - will show commuters the amount of CO2 saved every time they ride the metro. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Wednesday launched CarbonLite Metro Travel, an initiative to educate passengers about their significant contribution towards reducing carbon emissions by choosing metro trains, based on research done by The Energy and Resource Institute (TERI).The details on carbon emissions are currently unavailable for Delhi metro card users. The initiative aims to ensure widespread awareness of the positive impact of sustainable public transport.\"In line with India\\'s aim of achieving net zero emissions by 2070, the initiative intends to highlight the pivotal role each citizen plays in addressing the pressing issue of climate change through their transportation choices. DMRC is possibly the world\\'s first metro service to introduce such a feature in its tickets,\" said Anuj Dayal, principal executive director, corporate communications, DMRC.He added that the CO2 savings will be displayed and accumulated in the user\\'s DMRC mobile app for all journeys undertaken by the passenger, further enhancing the \\'feel-good factor\\'.For this initiative, a study done by TERI estimated the net CO2 emissions per passenger-km by Delhi Metro and five motorised modes of road transport - bus, private car, cab/taxi, three-wheeler (auto-rickshaw) and two-wheeler.\"Delhi Metro\\'s continuous efforts in environmental preservation have earned it a reputation as a frontrunner in sustainability within the global transportation landscape. The corporation holds the distinction of being the world\\'s first rail-based organisation to accrue carbon credits for innovative initiatives like regenerative braking and modal shift strategies. Additionally, DMRC has achieved significant strides in harnessing solar energy, with an impressive total solar power generation capacity of approximately 50 MwP, further solidifying its position as a pioneer in the mass transit sector,\" said Dayal.The introduction of QR-coded tickets on both paper and mobile platforms earlier this year has been met with enthusiastic responses from passengers. The app-based QR code ticketing option, launched by DMRC in June, has already garnered about 4.7 lakh downloads.\"This will encourage passengers to choose an eco-friendly mode of transport over motorised vehicles, contributing to a cleaner and greener environment,\" said DMRC.

       " 'LUCKNOW: Brace for bullet speed travel between Delhi and Varanasi via Ayodhya in the coming years. The train travel time, which takes around 11-12 hours at present will get reduced to 3 hours once the Delhi–Varanasi High-Speed Rail (DVHSR) project gets ready. The work has already started.The 865-km proposed High Speed Rail, commonly known as the Bullet Train, will connect Delhi with Varanasi through 12 stations including Lucknow, Ayodhya, Mathura, Etawah, Kannauj and Prayagraj.As per the project’s feasibility report, people will be able to travel between Delhi and Lucknow in 1 hour and 38 minutes.While the environment impact assessment, social impact surveys and utility identification along the proposed route are likely to start soon, the instructions are to avoid any forest or wildlife sanctuaries in the route.Besides connecting the national capital with several religious cities of Uttar Pradesh, the project is also expected to boost the real estate sector on the proposed rail route.The project will also benefit devotees who want to travel by train to Ayodhya, about 690km from Delhi, and currently takes more than 10 hours by train or road.The train will have a maximum speed of 350 kmph and an operation speed of 300 kmph. With a passenger capacity of 750, this train will be equipped with urgent earthquake detection and an alarm system for automatic braking.Multi-modal station integrationAs per the Prime Minister’s GatiShakti National Master Plan (NMP), the project will be integrated with the national multi-modal transport connectivity all along the route.In Delhi, for instance, interventions by means of foot overbridges (FOBs) with Metro stations, railway stations and the Inter-State Bus Terminus (ISBT), besides station parking facilities are proposed. Similar integrations at Noida are also proposed.At the underconstruction Jewar International Airport in Noida, the Jewar HSR station will be set up close to the airport and its integration by means of dedicated passenger walkway connection and underground roads to Metro and airport terminal buildings is proposed.At Lucknow, the HSR station is planned on the existing VIP road, about 0.5 km away from Singarnagar Metro station with which an foot overbridges connection is proposed. The Lucknow railway station will be about 5 km away and the distance to the Lucknow Airport will be about 4.5 km.The Lucknow-Ayodhya spur line (extension) alignment is proposed parallel to the existing railway line. The Ayodhya high-speed rail station will be about 2.5 km from the Ayodhya Airport and 10.5 km from the existing Ayodhya Railway Station. A proposed new road below the viaduct connecting to Prayagraj-Faizabad road will be explored.In Mathura, construction of new roads to connect Mathura and Vrindavan roads, dedicated bus facility and parking are proposed. In Agra, the extension of Agra Metro till the HSR station with parking and a dedicated bus facility will lead to a perfect integration.In Etawah, a new Etawah HSR station is planned along the Yamuna Expressway. The HSR station at Prayagraj will be 1 km from the existing Phaphamau railway station. Widening of roads and FOB connection between the HSR and railway station, widening of the bridge and increased regional commuter train services for integration with the existing Prayagraj railway station will also be explored.In addition, a water-based transport mode between the HSR station and Triveni Sangam could also be explored.In Varanasi, the proposed Banaras HSR station will be close to the existing Banaras (Manduadih) railway station. A foot overbridge connection between the two stations, parking plazas, redevelopment of Banaras railway station, a station square, a dedicated bus facility for destinations in Varanasi and integration of the high speed rail station with the proposed Metro and Ropeway Corridors may also be explored.Survey underwayThe Light Detection and Ranging Survey for DVHSR corridor began a few months ago. The LiDAR technology provides all the ground details and data in 3-4 months wherein this process normally takes 10-12 months. This technique uses a combination of laser data, GPS data, flight parameters and actual photographs to give accurate survey data. The report contains the survey of the entire route, including soil, terrain, rivers, drains and other vital information. The route alignment is planned along the existing Yamuna Expressway, Agra-Lucknow Expressway, forthcoming Ganga Expressway and the existing North Eastern Railway between Prayagraj and Varanasi.',\n",

Renowned designers such as Simone Rocha, JW Anderson, and Richard Quinn deliveredThis innovative styling hack was popularized by Lydia Langford, a fashion creator, and it has quickly gained a massive following on TikTok. The concept behind the \\'sandwich\\' styling hack is simple but effective: when putting together an outfit, coordinate the color or texture of your top and bottom garments. Lydia Langford explains this technique by saying, \"When putting together an outfit, consider choosing the same color on the bottom as you would the top. In this case, instead of wearing my black pumps, I choose to wear my white sandals to complete the look.\"Watch the video here:        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by ModeSens (@modesens) The \\'sandwich\\' styling hack, while making waves on TikTok, has actually been a part of the fashion industry for quite some time. This technique involves creating a balanced ensemble by coordinating two items with the same color or texture and adding a contrasting element in between. It\\'s a fashion approach that can transform any look, adding a touch of sophistication and coherence.What has led to the recent popularity of this styling hack is its simplicity and the pleasing aesthetics it offers. The \\'sandwich\\' method employs the power of symmetry to effortlessly enhance your overall appearance. Whether you\\'re heading to a relaxed brunch, a corporate event, or a gala dinner, this style rule adapts seamlessly to any setting, making it a timeless choice. One of the key advantages of this method is its ability to breathe new life into one’s existing wardrobe by combining clothing items in fresh and creative ways, thereby reducing the need for frequent shopping trips.So, how does it work in practice? Let\\'s take an example: a tailored black blazer as the \"bread,\" creates a sleek silhouette. High-waisted black trousers maintain the monochromatic theme, providing a clean foundation. The contrasting \"meat\" comes in the form of a vibrant silk scarf tied around the neck, making it a statement piece that elevates the entire ensemble to a new level of sophistication.Sandwich styling employs the power of symmetry to effortlessly enhance your overall appearance.  Source: PinterestThis styling approach extends beyond color coordination to the realm of materials and textures.One can play around with textures by wearing a soft, cashmere sweater with distressed denim jeans or try a faux fur jacket with sleek leather pants. Mixing and matching diverse textures gives the outfit depth and gains visual interest - turning a regular outfit into a stylish and captivating spectacle.The Week In FashionFurthermore, the \\'sandwich\\' styling hack opens up a realm of creative possibilities when it comes to playing with proportions and silhouettes. The freedom to experiment with contrasting sizes and shapes creates a visual dynamic that adds depth and a fashion-forward edge to the overall look. For example, pairing an oversized, slouchy sweater with tailored skinny jeans, achieves a captivating balance that exudes both comfort and style. Alternatively, combining a voluminous, flowy skirt with a fitted top creates a striking contrast that draws attention and showcases one’s fashion prowess.Beyond its versatility, it\\'s important to keep in mind that while the \\'sandwich\\' styling hack provides valuable fashion guidance, the ultimate rule of fashion is to express individuality. This technique should serve as a canvas for personal flair and comfort. Fashion is a potent form of self-expression, allowing people to communicate their personality, mood, and creativity. The \\'sandwich\\' method is just one of many tools in one’s sartorial toolkit, enabling a person to craft and narrate their distinct fashion story with confidence and authenticity. So, while embracing the technique is key, it is always important to remember to let individuality shine through, as it\\'s the key to making any outfit truly one’s own.',\n",

Del Core created “Slices Of Reverie” in the seduction of transparency while Alberta Ferrati chose fuchsia along with whites and browns. Etro created sorbet in signature prints while Genny opted for striking red with whites and rose gold in the collection “The Orchid Garden”. Emporio Armani played radiant, weightless with the lightest fabric discreetly illuminated by the touches of metallics and iridescence, woven and embroidered yet palpable as veils. While Moschino had a bit of all these elements. The Bicester Collection was nurturing the next generation in candy pop while Blue Marine chose to go gold metallic with lots of sheer. Ferragamo took metallics and reds and greens as the collection’s favourite entity.

(AP Photo/Luca Bruno)Earthy ItalianBrands such as MaxMara, Gucci, Aniye Records and Bottega Veneta chose to focus more on Italian tailoring along with other brands. Where quiet luxury was mainstream and garments were more towards subtle sophistication of finishing, cuts and authenticity. Brands such as Act N1 and Philosophy did indulge in all the trends we churned out above but the most targeted area was the finishing touch. Tom Ford marked the debut of creative director Peter Hawking exploring all cuts Italian for the spring/summer 24 collection. Prada was the classic match for Italian luxury which is a more finishing-centric, womenswear collection formal silhouette, borrowed from menswear and reimagined in architectural forms that reconsider the archetypal contours of formal rigour. Many classic Italian brands propose absolute freedom of the body expressed in lightweight dresses in floaty fabrics that challenge the language of classic tailoring because that’s the most significant value of Italian brands. They are known for their finishing touch and tailoring in subtle colours and rich fabrics.A model wears a creation as part of the Gucci women's Spring Summer 2024 collection presented in Milan, Italy, Friday, Sept. 22, 2023.

We spotted all the essentials in this season. Milan Fashion Week was metaphysical by all means. Cooler temps took over Milan in between the evenings, so showgoers had their knitwear game on point, including a few cosy crewnecks here and a statement cardigan touch there. Oversized blazers and tailored coats with tiny bralettes underneath are still stealing the street show along with sneakers, chunky loafers, and neon-tinted heels for a splash of colour. Milanese will never disappoint us with the pop of colours no matter what age group or gender they belong to. Via Monte Napoleone is all about smart Italians flaunting their vibrancy in fine-tailored neon pops whether it’s ready-to-wear or leather accessories. \",\n",

One of her recent sari looks styled by Who Wore What When caught our attention. It was a stunning Rangkat sari from the label Shanti Banaras. The sari was an amalgamation of warm earthy hues such as gold, green, peach, and shimmering bronze and had colourblocking hatchwork motifs throughout the body. Paired with a gilded blouse that had the same hatchwork pattern and statement jewellery, the actress looked a vision in the gorgeous sari. Vidya\\'s stunning sari costs INR 15,795. And if you are wondering what is a Rangkat sari and what makes it so special? Here is everything you need to know about this exquisite weave.Vidya Balan is a connoisseur of Indian textiles. In the picture she is seen wearing the rangkat sari from Banaras. Source: Shantibanaras What is a Rangkat sari?A Rangkat sari is a type of Banarasi sari that is made using a complex and intricate technique of weaving. The word Rangkat means \"colored warp\" in Hindi, and refers to the process of dyeing the warp threads in different colors to create patterns on the fabric. The weft threads are usually plain or zari, and are used to bind the warp threads together. The result is a vibrant and colorful sari that has motifs on both sides of the fabric.What are the features of a Rangkat sari?A Rangkat sari is characterized by its rich colors, fine texture, and elaborate designs. The motifs are usually inspired by nature, such as flowers, birds, animals, and geometric shapes. The border and the pallu of the sari are often embellished with zari or brocade work, adding to the elegance and grandeur of the sari. A Rangkat sari can weigh up to 1.5 kg, depending on the amount of zari used.(In Picture) Colourful rangkat sari with nature inspired motifs. Source: PinterestHow to style a Rangkat sari?A Rangkat sari is a versatile piece that can be worn for various occasions, from weddings to festivals to casual outings. The best way to style a Rangkat sari is to let it be the star of the show and keep the rest of the look simple and minimal. A solid-colored blouse that matches one of the colors in the sari is a good choice, as it will not clash with the vibrant hues of the sari. Alternatively, one can opt for a contrasting blouse that adds some drama and contrast to the look. For accessories, one can go for statement earrings or necklaces that complement the sari, or keep it subtle with small studs or bangles. A sleek bun or a low ponytail will complete the look with grace and elegance.Vidya Balan\\'s beautiful Rangkat sari is a testament to her impeccable taste and her support for local weavers and artisans, which she has done quite often and throughout her career as an actor. The star has shown us how to rock this exquisite weave with confidence and style.

       " 'She was first seen in Bigg Boss OTT and little did anyone know that this girl from Lucknow will become the most famous internet personality in a short span of time. It all started with Uorfi Javed stepping out wearing the most anomalous outfits and a bunch of paparazzi sharing her videos on their Instagram handles. To say that her outfits were questionable is subjective, but she certainly learnt how to remain in the limelight with all that paraphernalia used in creating her dresses. She is capable of making a top from bubble gum or a dress from a trash bag. Some may find it distasteful, but if you are someone who thinks fashion is a form of self-expression then perhaps Uorfi is doing it right.In a previous interview given to The Times of India, Uorfi had explained why she likes to dress up differently, \"Whatever I do, I do for myself because all of us want to look and feel good. And if people get provoked by a dress, then there is a problem there... they need help,\" she had claimed.Uorfi has made a living out of her quirky dressing sensibility. She earns more than a lot of other TV stars or influencers. From being a DIY queen to everything in between, Uorfi has made the adage - fake it till you make it, absolutely true for herself.Even the leading names in fashion industry approve of Uorfi\\'s style now. She had recently attended the store launch of designer Amit Aggarwal in New Delhi and the designer believes that Uorfi is unapologetically herself in the way she dresses up. \"I often look at Uorfi\\'s journey as a one of transformation, that metamorphoses everyday into something new. It’s clear as day that she thoroughly enjoys the process of putting together looks and has fun with clothing. She isn’t afraid to express herself through fashion and isn’t that what fashion is eventually all about ? It’s hard to not take notice of someone who has so much fun in the process of being unapologetically themselves and uses fashion as an art form and I think it was only a matter of time she got her due love from everyone,\" cites Aggarwal.She had also been invited by designer duo Shantnu & Nikhil and Gaurav Gupta for their respective store launches in Mumbai. Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla were the first ones to dress up Uorfi in their creation when the other designers were still not sure of sourcing out their designs to Uorfi. She even played their muse for one of their campaigns. “We used her for a movie. People said ‘she’s got nothing’ but she is daring, where are girls like this? And a mind of her own and a bright mind.

       " 'NEW DELHI: India wants Saudi Arabia\\'s Aramco to participate in its planned 6.5 million metric tons (MMT) strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) programme as the South Asian nation wants to strengthen ties with its key oil supplier, according to a document seen by Reuters. The two nations have been talking about Aramco\\'s participation in the SPR programme for years. The talks, however, gained traction after Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman\\'s meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month. \"Under Phase II Strategic Petroleum Reserves Programme construction of two new commercial-cum-strategic petroleum reserves of 6.5 MMT have been approved,\" the Indian government said in an internal document, adding that \"Saudi Arabia\\'s Aramco can be invited to participate in the Phase II.\" Aramco declined to comment, while the Saudi government did not respond to emails seeking comment.  India\\'s prime ministers office, oil ministry and finance ministry did not respond either. In 2021, India overhauled its SPR policy allowing commercial sale of the crude to boost private participation in the building of new storage facilities, mirroring a model adopted by countries such as Japan and South Korea. India, the world\\'s third-biggest oil importer and consumer, imports over 80% of its oil needs and has built strategic storage at three locations in southern India to store over 5 million tons of oil to protect against supply disruption. Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) has leased 750,000 tons of oil storage in the 1.5 million ton SPR in the southern city of Mangaluru. India has conducted two road shows for the second phase of its SPR programme that received interest from companies including Trafigura, British Petroleum, Petrochina, Hyundai, Gulf Energy, Glencore and Shell, a government statement said. Regarding a potential deal between India and Saudi Aramco, KPMG Partner Anish De commented: \"Getting the investment there will align the economic and political interest. There is good economic and political reasons for the two countries to do it.\" During the visit by the crown prince to India, Saudi Arabia announced plans for an investment facilitation office in India\\'s Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, a tax-neutral financial service centre.  India is also scouting for land to build a 1.2 million metric tonnes per year refinery and petrochemical project in western India with participation of Saudi Aramco and ADNOC. The two governments will form a task force to remove hurdles like land acquisition, which has delayed the project, which was conceived in 2018.

Quotas for some overseas sales can be issued if domestic supply improves, they said.India recorded its weakest monsoon in five years and any drop in agricultural output will heap pressure on the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to control food inflation ahead elections next month and in 2024. Export curbs will squeeze the market and likely boost futures in New York and London.A spokesperson who represents India’s food and commerce ministries didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.India introduced a quota system in 2022-23 and restricted sugar exports to about 6 million tons after late rains reduced production, compared with an unrestricted 11 million tons a year earlier.According to a Bloomberg survey of 14 analysts, traders and millers last month, most said India may not export any sugar this season due to lower output. Two respondents said shipments could total at least 2 million tons.Raw sugar futures surged to a 12-year high in September on concerns around tight supply, despite a bumper harvest from Brazil, the world’s top producer. Some parts of India’s Karnataka and Maharashtra states — key growing regions — were among the driest areas this monsoon, according to the weather office.Output from Thailand, the world’s second-largest exporter, is poised to slide by almost a fifth in the upcoming harvest because of a severe drought, according to an industry group estimate last month.

They’re part of a larger consortium in talks for the syndicated loan to billionaire Gautam Adani’s conglomerate. Some institutions were in discussions to lend $400 million each, in what could become one of the biggest loan deals in Asia this year, Bloomberg reported last month citing people familiar with the matter. No new information was given on the status of that group of banks. The prospective deal adds to evidence that the group, with business interests stretching from ports to green energy, is closing the chapter on the allegations of malfeasance made by US shortseller Hindenburg Research earlier this year. The claims — repeatedly denied by Adani officials — caused a selloff in the stocks and bonds of group firms. Negotiations with global banks on debt refinancing stalled as some banks balked, Bloomberg reported in February. Spokespeople at Barclays, Deutsche and Standard Chartered all declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg on Tuesday. A representative for Adani Group did not offer any immediate comment.Adani bought the India assets of Switzerland’s Holcim Ltd. in 2022, as the conglomerate looked to move beyond its core business of operating ports, power plants and coal mines and into areas like data centers, airports, digital services, retail and media.

In simple terms, an apartment purchased for Rs 23 crore in 2014, spanning 10,000 square feet, is now valued at nearly four times its original price, at Rs 85 crore.This trend of high-value apartment transactions is also gaining ground in Delhi, with transactions surpassing Rs 1 lakh per square foot.

Shvesh Bandivadekar, veterinarian from Kothrud, said, “About 50% of the cases that I have consulted on are of infections. We are advising pet parents to give boiled and cooled tap water to pets.”']"

However, England\\'s captain, Jos Buttler, is expressing greater concern about the condition of the outfield in Dharamsala, which he believes is suboptimal for World Cup matches.Former England batsman and current Afghanistan head coach, Jonathan Trott, raised questions about the outfield\\'s condition after spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahmannarrowly avoided injury when his knee jammed into the sandy surface.Read AlsoICC World Cup: England look to bounce back against BangladeshDefending champions England suffered a heavy defeat to New Zealand in their World Cup opener, leaving captain Jos Buttler eager for a comeback against Bangladesh. The loss exposed weaknesses in England\\'s bowling attack, as New Zealand\\'s batsmen dominated the matchDespite theInternational Cricket Council (ICC) granting the outfield an \"average\" rating, permitting it to host World Cup matches, concerns regarding player safety while fielding persist.Jos Buttler, addressing reporters on Monday in anticipation of the match against Bangladesh, voiced his reservations about the outfield, stating, \"It\\'s poor in my own opinion. Any time you\\'re talking about being careful diving or sort of being careful when you\\'re fielding, it goes against everything you want to be as a team. So that\\'s obviously not ideal, the way the surface is, the outfield. But we won\\'t use it as an excuse, we\\'ll adapt to it.\"However, Buttler emphasised that the team would not use the outfield conditions as an excuse and would adapt to the situation. England, the defending champions, are looking to recover from their comprehensive nine-wicket loss to New Zealand in the tournament\\'s opening match in Ahmedabad.The concerns over an unsafe outfield compound the challenges faced by a team already worried about the fitness of Ben Stokes, who missed the first match due to a minor hip issue. Buttler acknowledged that players ideally want to give their all in the field without concerns about safety and added, \"You want to put your body on the line and be trying to save every single run or have confidence in the field. So, it\\'s not as good as it could be or should be, but it\\'s going to be the same for both teams, and the wicket looks fantastic.\"ICC World Cup 2023: New Zealand beat England in opening match by 9 wickets, take sweet revenge of loss in 2019 finalRegarding the team\\'s underwhelming start to their title defence, Buttler was candid, saying, \"We know we didn\\'t play as well as we can in the last game and you\\'re always desperate to put that right, both individually and as a team. So, there\\'s plenty of hunger in the group, and we\\'re excited to get back on the field.\"England\\'s match against Afghanistan on October 15 in New Delhi appears to be a more realistic target for Ben Stokes to return to action. Buttler noted that Stokes has been back in the nets and working toward full fitness, but it is unlikely he will be available for the upcoming match against Bangladesh.(With inputs from Reuters)',\n",

Australia, opting to bat first, were in a good position at 110 for two before left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja (3/38) triggered a middle-order collapse.Smith praised the Indian spinners and the pitch conditions, saying, \"All their spinners bowled really nicely. Obviously, they had the wicket to suit as well. It was challenging against the spin since they are all very quality spinners. They really worked well together, and we struggled to get on top of them.\"Besides Jadeja, wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav claimed two wickets, and off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin took one.In response, India chased down the target of 200, with Virat Kohli scoring 85 and KL Rahul remaining unbeaten on 97, despite India being 2/3 in the second over.Smith credited Kohli and Rahul for their composed batting, saying, \"It was game on. Unfortunately, we couldn\\'t take it. Virat and Rahul played with a lot of composure. They played really smart cricket.\"Steve Smith. (IANS Photo)Regarding the challenge posed by the pitch, Smith mentioned, \"It was a challenging wicket, and we also saw a fair bit of spin taking place, along with a bit of movement for the seam bowlers off the cracks. So, obviously, it was difficult.\"Smith, who top-scored for Australia with 46 runs, felt he was playing well but couldn\\'t convert it into a bigger score.Looking ahead, Australia will face South Africa in their next match. Smith commented on the unknown pitch conditions in Lucknow and the potential return of Marcus Stoinis to the team, saying, \"Who knows (about Lucknow\\'s surface)? It depends on what the surface looks like and how we need to play on that. So, we wait to see till we go there and figure out. Yeah, we have a few options that we can go in with. Marcus (Stoinis) is back with the team potentially. So, we have to wait and see how we can fit them in.\"',\n",

       " {'sequence': \"NEW DELHI: FC Cincinnati prevailed 1-0 against Inter Miami on Sunday, sealing their status as one of the league's dominant forces this season. The match saw the eagerly awaited return of global football icon Lionel Messi, but it was ultimately FC Cincinnati who emerged victorious.Inter Miami (9-17-6, 33 points) entered the contest with their playoff aspirations hanging by a thread. However, the loss, coupled with CF Montreal's win over the Portland Timbers, put an end to their postseason dreams. Messi, who had been sidelined for two weeks with a reaggravated scar tissue injury in his leg, made a comeback in the 55th minute but couldn't find the breakthrough Inter Miami desperately needed.FC Cincinnati (20-5-8, 68 points) continued their remarkable season, securing the Supporters' Shield for boasting the best regular-season record in the league. The win was another feather in their cap.Goalkeeper Roman Celentano played a crucial role for Cincinnati, making two crucial saves, while Inter Miami's Drake Callender put up a valiant effort with five saves of his own.Despite controlling the game with 61.6% possession, Inter Miami struggled to put the ball on target, managing just two shots on goal out of 16 attempts.The first half was rife with excitement as Inter Miami rattled the woodwork on three separate occasions. Tomas Aviles struck the crossbar squarely from the centre of the box, Josef Martinez narrowly missed the far post, and Benjamin Cremaschi's attempt ricocheted off the crossbar, all in a scoreless first half.Messi's introduction in the 55th minute injected hope into the Miami faithful, but his free-kick attempt in the 59th minute sailed over the crossbar.The deadlock was finally broken when FC Cincinnati capitalised on a steal in Miami's territory. Yuya Kubo unleashed a shot that Callender parried to his right, only for Alvaro Barreal to pounce and slot the ball into the net, securing his fifth goal of the season in the 78th minute.Messi had opportunities to make an impact, including a left-footed shot in the 87th minute that narrowly missed the target.In the dying moments of the game, Messi won two late fouls near the box. On the first free-kick, his delivery was cleared by Cincinnati, leading to a fruitless Miami corner. On the second, Messi's shot soared over the bar, sealing FC Cincinnati's 1-0 victory.The final whistle marked the end of Inter Miami's playoff dreams, while FC Cincinnati continued to celebrate a historic season, cementing their status as one of the league's best.(With inputs from Reuters)\",\n",

This thrilling encounter in the Premier League ended in a 2-2 draw on Sunday.The home team seized the advantage in the 20th minute when Simon Adingra capitalised on a mistake by former Brighton midfielder Alexis Mac Allister and slotted the ball into the net.However, Salah responded for Liverpool in the 40th minute, capping off an intricate team play with his trademark left-footed finish.Salah extended his team's lead from the penalty spot during first-half stoppage time, converting after Dominik Szoboszlai was fouled by Pascal Gross. Salah placed his shot to the left of goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen.Substitute Ryan Gravenberch, who came on for Harvey Elliott at halftime, missed a golden chance to put Liverpool two up in the 54th minute when his close-range effort from Szoboszlai's pass cannoned back off the crossbar.Dutchman Gravenberch, who signed for Liverpool from Bayern Munich on the last day of the transfer window, made another fine chance in the 65th minute, but his shot lacked power and was easily saved.Brighton had their chances in the second half and they howled for a penalty in the 69th minute as Kaoru Mitoma cut in from the right and unleashed a shot which they claimed hit the arm of Virgil van Dijk, but the referee disagreed.Brighton forced an equaliser in the 78th minute when Andy Robertson decided against trying to clear Solli March's free kick, allowing defender Dunk to volley home.If Gravenberch's miss was bad, Joao Pedro's for Brighton in the 84th minute was arguably worse as he failed to hit the target from close range with the goal at his mercy, but the hosts held on for the draw to stay sixth in the table on 16 points, one behind third-placed Liverpool.(With Reuters Inputs)\",\n",

The Exter was launched at an introductory price of Rs 6 lakh, ex-showroom for the base-spec EX MT trim. The price hike will be applicable to all the Exter variants except the EX MT and SX (O) Connect AMT. Among them, the SX(O) Connect MT dual-tone sees the largest hike at Rs 16,000, while the top-spec SX (O) Connect AMT dual-tone undergoes the smallest increase of Rs 5,000. Other variants now cost up to Rs. 10,400 more.Hyundai Exter Review: Can it Punch out its rivals? | TOI AutoUnder the hood, the Hyundai Exter gets a 1.2-liter, four-cylinder, naturally aspirated petrol engine mated to either a five-speed manual or AMT transmission. Additionally, there's a CNG variant, which belts out 69 hp and 95.2 Nm of peak torque, while the petrol mill produces 83 hp and 114 Nm of torque.The Hyundai Exter rivals the likes of Maruti Suzuki Ignis, Citroen C3, and the segment leading Tata Punch. While the model has been able to attract customers and clock healthy sales numbers, it has, however, not affected its direct rival Punch’s sales. Going by the sales data from the recent months, Punch has continued to be the segment leader in the micro SUV category and has been growing persistently. However, it is also true that Hyundai is posting good numbers following the arrival of the Exter, with the model contributing a fair bit as the company registered its highest-ever monthly sales in October in 2023.Stay tuned to TOI Auto for latest updates on the automotive sector and do follow us on our social media handles on Facebook, Instagram, and X.\",\n",

       " {'sequence': \"Canada is one of the most highlighted countries in the world, it is popular among young and aspirational Indians who want to pursue higher education and professional opportunities and is even considered to be one of the safest countries in the world. However, one thing that Canada is not known for, is its automotive industry. Don’t get us wrong, people do drive cars in Canada, however, they are either American, German or even Indian. The lack of a domestic car brand in Canada got us intrigued and here are some interesting bits of information that we discovered related to Canadian cars and why they failed to make a mark.Canada’s first automobile (1867):While Canada may not have its own car brand, it did try as far back as in 1867. More specifically, this was when watchmaker and jeweller, Henry Seth Taylor, developed his own steam buggy. While Taylor’s steam buggy was Canada’s first-ever ‘automobile’ invented in the country, it did not feature any brakes. The watchmaker had reportedly crashed the steam buggy into a creek soon after introducing it to the world.Is Nissan too late taking the AMT route with the Magnite EZ Shift? | TOI AutoCanadian auto industry takes shape (1899):The automotive industry in Canada actually started to take off almost three decades after Taylor’s failed steam buggy concept. It began with the arrival of the Le Roy Manufacturing Company in 1899. Brothers Milton and Nelson Good had founded the company and used an American Oldsmobile as the foundation for their first car. They converted an American Mobile steamer to run on petrol, it was a single-cylinder engine in its final form. However, even this Canadian automobile did not come with a braking system. To stop the car, the driver was supposed to use the reverse pedal and bring the car to a stop. This was due to the epicyclic transmission that the vehicle had. While the Le Roy automobile can be considered as the first-mass production car to go on sale in Canada. The business did not grow and the company was shut by 1907.Oldsmobile Model 6C 'curved dashboard' Source: By DougW at English Wikipedia Ford Motor Company of Canada (1904):While the Le Roy Manufacturing Company failed to succeed, around the same time Henry Ford struck a deal with Canadian Gordon M. Mcgregor of Windsor and set up the Ford Motor Company of Canada in 1904. This was just a year after production of Ford cars had started back in Detroit, United States. Offering two car models that did get brakes, Ford found success in Canada with the Model C and the world famous Model T car.Ford Model T - Source: Wikipedia - By ModelTMitchWhy we don’t see Canadian only cars till today:Canada’s automobile market has always been under heavy American influence, while domestic OEMs failed to succeed, American brands such as Ford, Buick, Pontiac and Chrysler did well in the market and were trusted by the Canadian public. However in a bid to protect local manufacturing, Canada did impose a tariff on imported cars back in 1936. This prompted American carmakers to develop and produce Canada-only models such as the Ford Monarch, Chrysler Fargo and the Pontiac Beaumont. While these cars costed less for the Canadian car buyer, the country eventually realised that tariffs on imported cars was actually harming its economy by limiting trade with its biggest contributor, America. By 1965, the Canadian government removed the tariffs imposed in imported cars and the era of Canada-only cars came to an end with the exception of some cars voluntarily being created only for Canada such as the Chevrolet Corvair in the 1960s.Pontiac Beaumont 1960's - Source: Wikipedia - By M 93 Indian auto brands finding success in Canada:Currently, Indian brands such as Tata Motors and Royal Enfield are offering their entire portfolios to the Canadian public. From the Tata Tiago.ev, Safari to the Royal Enfield Classic 350, Himalayan and Interceptor 650. As the Indian automotive sector continues to grow we can expect more Indian vehicles to be seen in Canada but the likelihood of a mass-market Canadian vehicle making a global impression remains almost nill. \",\n",

Beijing Hyundai Motor is selling the land use rights, equipment and other facilities belonging to its plant as the South Korean automaker rejigs its strategy in China amid fierce price competition and slowing demand.

Additionally, under the Bus Body Code, it will be mandatory to get bus body certification from government recognised testing agencies from mid 2025. The notification has also proposed the installation of special ‘indirect vision’ devices, over and above the rear view mirrors, to help guide bus drivers and make manoeuvres more safe. Nissan Magnite EZ Shift review: Most affordable AMT SUV but has a flaw | TOI AutoCurrent scenario:Right now bus body builders can self-certify whether they are complying with the Bus Body Code or not. However, the new mandate from the Road Transport Ministry prescribes bus body builders to get certification from government agencies such as ARAI and ICAT. The updated Bus Body Code also specifies guidelines for location of emergency exits, spacing between the seats, electric wiring, structure vibrations, braking performance and vehicle stability function that need to be complied with.What are the ‘indirect vision’ devices:Bus drivers often do not get the full vision of what’s behind their vehicles or in their blindspots. ‘Indirect vision’ devices or more simply, camera systems and digital monitors that help mitigate this problem. They can be compared to Level 1 ADAS safety systems that we see in modern cars such as the Blind Spot Detection systems. Cameras placed on the blind spots and at the rear, can project a clear and real-time video feed of what’s happening onto displays placed in front of the driver. This makes the buses, passengers and commuters on the road safer. However, while the certifications will be mandatory, installing these ‘indirect vision’ devices will be voluntary for bus operators.Representational image.

We are creating an enabling framework so that the vehicle owners can get them.” On the matter of bus body certification he said, “This is a much needed step to ensure that the designs and bodies of all buses are sound and meet the requirement for passenger safety.”',\n",

       " {'sequence': 'The European Union\\'s investigation into subsidies for China-made electric vehicles (EV) exported to Europe could do more harm than good, BMW\\'s chief financial officer said on Friday, warning of a potentially big backlash from Beijing. Walter Mertl said he did not endorse punitive tariffs and the investigation would shield those who do not have significant sales in China but would impact every carmaker doing business there. \"The backlash, like a boomerang, can be bigger than what one imagined,\" he said, referring to potential retaliation by China on European carmakers. China is the biggest market for Germany\\'s three top carmakers. BMW exports the iX3 from China to Europe and will export the Mini from next year, leaving it vulnerable to possible EU tariffs on imports from China as well as any backlash from China on its sales in the country.Mercedes-Benz EQE interior review: Smarter than your smartphone? | TOI Auto While 90% of BMW cars sold in China are produced locally, some materials are shipped from Europe to China, Mertl said. China has condemned the EU investigation, which formally began on Thursday, as out of line with World Trade Organization rules and detrimental to the global growth of EV sales.FINANCIAL TARGETS ON TRACK Speaking ahead of BMW\\'s third quarter results early next month, Mertl said the company would be able to present \"good numbers\" in line with its raised forecast for a 9-10.5% margin on earnings before interest and taxes. Asked whether the premium carmaker was seeing dampened demand for EVs reported by Volkswagen in recent weeks, Mertl said EV sales were rising and the company was on track to hit its goal of 15% fully-electric sales for the year. Some supply chain problems in logistics and transport persisted and could carry on for the next six months, he added.',\n",

       " {'sequence': \" and Meta are two of the biggest, if not only, players in the mixed-reality segment. Meta has established its presence in this domain for several years, but Apple's recent unveiling of its Vision Pro has undoubtedly made a significant impact, altering the landscape.  The two companies are already readying the next iterations of their headsets, even though their current ones are still to hit the shelves, as they plan to mainstream VR. Apple is wanting to make its headset more comfortable, notes Mark Gurman of Bloomberg in the latest edition of his newsletter Power On, while Meta is taking cues from Apple's Vision Pro for its next headset, ditching the controllers to make Quest a little more affordable. Gurman writes that Apple is confident that the Vision Pro is superior. However, there are concerns over whether consumers will see the need for the device, given its high price of $3,500.  Meta, on the other hand, believes that the Quest 3's gaming ecosystem and $500 price tag make it a more appealing option. While it's difficult to bet against Apple, Meta can adjust its features based on what Apple adds to the Vision Pro and how customers respond to the technology. But Vision Pro has caused some turmoil inside Meta.  Meta is afraid of Apple, according to an insider. “We’re in the ‘afraid of Apple’ stage,” told the person, much like how the mobile industry was before the   launch. Zuckerberg shifting Quest’s focus from the metaverse to gaming and productivity, is the direct response to Apple's Vision Pro, which is what even Apple is doing. Meta is developing a cheaper, more comfortable headset called Ventura. They plan to remove bundled controllers, allowing users to use hand gestures or buy controllers separately. Meanwhile, Apple aims for a lighter and smaller successor to the Vision Pro, which even comes with built-in prescribed lenses. That’s not it; Headsets are the beginning of this segment, and glasses are to be the next big thing, at least that's what Meta hopes for. Even though Apple stopped work on AR glasses a year ago, Meta still sees them as its holy grail and plans to release AR display glasses in 2025.

       " {'sequence': \"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das recently proposed the introduction of card-on-file tokenisation (CoFT) facility at the issuer-bank level. He cited the growing acceptance and benefits of tokenisation of card data while announcing the proposal. For those unaware, RBI introduced new channels for card on file for tokenisation. This means that credit/debit card users will be able to generate card tokens on their bank’s website or app instead of e-commerce websites/apps while shopping online, as is the case at present. This will eliminate data security concerns regarding token generation at e-commerce or merchant portals. The move also aims to give customers greater control over managing their card tokens. What the RBI announcement means To recall, RBI introduced Card-on-File Tokenisation (CoFT) in September 2021 and began implementation from October 1, 2022. So far, over 56 crore tokens are reported to have been created on which transactions with value of over Rs 5 lakh crore have been undertaken. Tokenisation is also said to have improved transaction security and transaction approval rate.  Until now, the cardholders had to create different tokens through each merchant’s application or webpage. This would require time and effort from the users. Going forward, tokens will be created at the issuer bank level and linked to their existing accounts with various e-commerce applications. This will eliminate the duplication of tokenisation process at each app or website along with increased transaction security, resulting in reduced card-data-related frauds.  What exactly is tokenisation Tokenisation replaces a debit or credit card’s 16-digit number with a unique token that is specific to user's card and specific for one merchant at a time. The token hides the true details of your card, so that in case a data leak happens from the merchant website, the hackers cannot misuse the card. This token contains no personal information and keeps changing. Tokens can be used for online transactions, mobile point-of-sale transactions, or in-app transactions. A customer can choose whether or not to let his, her card tokenised. Tokenization guidelines are applicable to both debit and credit card and have to be tokenized for future online purchase as opted by customers.

       " {'sequence': 'Some industry bodies have countered telecom companies demands to regulate OTTs and charge them ‘fair share’ by submitting counter comments on the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) consultation paper on the regulatory framework for OTT communication services and the selective banning of OTT services. For clarity, the recent proposal from TRAI on selective banning of OTT or internet services has resulted in a fierce debate among the industry bodies, internet companies and startup founders. The Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) said the majority of ‘OTT services’, are in addition to, and not in derogation or substitution of, traditional telecommunications (or broadcasting) services. \"OTTs provide bundled services that cannot be separated into ‘OTT Communication Services,’ ‘OTT Broadcasting services,’ etc., making defining OTT overall or subsets of OTT for regulatory purposes near impossible,” ITI said in a statement. However, the functions of these OTT services are already regulated under the IT Act 2000. Broadband India Forum (BIF) said that the demand for network usage fees from OTTs by telecom operators is outdated and would violate net neutrality principles. “Overregulation of the OTTs would be counterproductive, as this will lead to a higher cost to customers and reduce consumer choice. Besides, it would also adversely impact innovation, lead to discrimination, adversely impact smaller entities and startups, and lead to a violation of Net Neutrality guidelines,” said T.V. Ramachandran, BIF President. The Alliance of Digital India Foundation (ADIF), a policy think tank for digital startups, said that calls for revenue-sharing arrangements between telecom service providers (TSPs) and OTT applications are primarily grounded in the misperception that OTTs are benefiting without making any contributions. “The proposed implementation of the suggested revenue-sharing model carries the potential to discourage the growth of digital enterprises. This model introduces a volume-based revenue-sharing system that could impede their sustained expansion,” the ADIF said in a statement. Additionally, it introduces an additional cost associated with accessing free or affordable content, and a portion of this expenditure may eventually be passed on to consumers, thereby increasing the cost of internet usage. The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) saod that robust regulatory frameworks for digital service providers already exist in India. “They are also variously required to comply with the Consumer Protection Act and Rules for consumer welfare, and the Competition Act for economic regulation. Under the IT Rules, digital service providers/OTT service providers are subject to dedicated compliance and reporting requirements. Therefore, the introduction of a telecom regulatory regime for OTT services would undoubtedly qualify as an act of over-regulation,” the IAMAI argued.

The KCC has warned the tech giants of possible fines amounting to $50.5 million. According to the KCC, the two companies have forced app developers into using specific payment methods, causing delays in app review, and creating an unfair environment in the app market. The commission is notifying companies of necessary corrective action and will determine fines. In 2021, South Korea amended the Telecommunication Business Act to ban app store operators from mandating the use of their payment systems by software developers. The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) stated that Google and Apple\\'s enforcement of certain payment methods, and Apple\\'s \"discriminatory charging of fees to domestic app developers,\" are likely to undermine the law\\'s purpose of promoting fair competition. Apple released a statement disagreeing with the conclusions presented by the KCC in their Examiner\\'s Report. They believe that their recent changes to the App Store comply with the Telecommunications Business Act. Apple stated that they will continue to engage with the KCC to share their views, as they have always done in the past. Google told Reuters that what KCC has shared today is a \"pre-notice\", and that they will carefully review it and submit their response. Once the final written decision is shared with them, they will evaluate it and decide on the next course of action. Korean regulators will impose fines of up to 68 million won ($50.47 million) on Google and Apple after hearing from both companies. Google’s history with South Korean regulators Earlier this year, in May, South Korea\\'s Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fined Google $32 million for preventing developers from releasing mobile video games on One Store, a local Korean peer of Google\\'s Play Store.  Google allegedly required Korean video game companies to exclusively release their new games on the Play Store from June 2016 to April 2018, which banned the local game makers from releasing their content on One Store. In 2021, the KFTC fined Google $177 million for abusing its market dominance in the Android operating system market. Google claims that it has contributed to the growth and successful global expansion of Korean mobile game developers that have launched their games on Play over the last decade.

       " {'sequence': 'IIT-Delhi researchers have achieved an experimental breakthrough on secure quantum communication up to a distance of 380 kilometres in standard telecom fiber with a very low error rate. This is said to be helpful in securing financial transactions and secret codes. The results of the research have also been published in the \"Nature Scientific Reports\" journal. This long secure length is said to be the highest achieved so far, not only in India but globally, for the Differential Phase Shift (DPS) QKD protocol, according to officials. \"Such low quantum bit error rate (QBER) makes the quantum communication resistance to collective and individual attacks and implementable for various applications, such as securing financial transactions, medical records and secret codes,\" said Bhaskar Kanseri, lead researcher and associate professor at IIT-Delhi\\'s Physics Department and Optics and Photonics Centre. \"It is also capable of securing network communication such as Internet of Things (IoT) and ready to revolutionise the field of cyber security,\" Kanseri said. He added that this realisation using state-of-the-art technology will not only help in reducing the need for trusted nodes for intercity or long-distance quantum key exchange, increasing the security of the cryptography scheme, but also prove to be a crucial step towards the commercial production of long-distance secure practical QKD devices. In quantum communication, security is guaranteed by the laws of Quantum Physics and, in principle, it can not be broken even using a quantum computer, Kanseri explained. \"This QKD demonstration shows methods to get rid of the intermediate trusted nodes, which are the weak security loopholes and are vulnerable to several kinds of attacks. It paves ways for more secure long distance communication useful for strategic areas such as defence and online banking, making digital transactions safer in the near future,\"  Facebook Twitter Linkedin end of article 10 7 8 9 9 8 9 7 9 10 12 12',\n",

       " {'sequence': 'Earlier this year, a judge set November 6 as a trial in an antitrust case against  . Fortnite maker Epic Games, dating app giant Match Group which owns Tinder and others have alleged the company of abusing its power in the Android app market and harming the competition through Google Play Store policies. Now, a list of witnesses who will testify next month in a California court has been released. It includes top level executives from both companies. Epic listed 53 witnesses it either will or might call. These witnesses include Google and Alphabet CEO  , Google and Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney. Along with these top executives, Andy Rubin, who is one of the co-founders of the Android operating system, is also on the list. He worked at Google until 2014 and is under the “may call” witness list. Other than him, two other Android co-founders — Nick Sears, who left Google in 2013 and Rich Miner may also be called.  Meanwhile, Activision CFO Armin Zerza and former Open Handset Alliance head Eric Chu are also listed as witnesses. Why Epic is suing Google Epic is suing Google alleging malpractices related to Google Play Store. It claimed that after Epic was ousted from Google Play Store, the company launched an anticompetitive campaign to keep other developers from following suit. It says that the company paid millions of dollars to some to keep them. Google has maintained that the program is “proof that Google Play competes fairly with numerous rivals for developers,” it said. Both Google and   removed Epic from their app stores because the company introduced a direct payment option in Fortnite, flouting the app stores’ rules. Apple has largely won the case.

       " {'sequence': 'The US-based telecom gear maker Juniper Networks plans to cut more than 400 jobs. These planned layoffs will be across the company\\'s locations globally. According to a statement, the company will be incurring a cost of $59 million as a result of these job cuts. Of this, severance and termination expenses will likely comprise $40 million. In addition, in a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Juniper expects to incur other restructuring and related costs of approximately $19 million.  What SEC filing says about job cuts \"The [plan] is the result of a thorough review of the Company’s business objectives, and is intended to focus on realigning resources and investments in long-term growth opportunities,\" Juniper said in the filing. \"The Company believes the Plan will further allow it to continue to prudently manage operating expenses in order to deliver improved operating margin,\" the statement added.  Juniper said that it expects the layoffs to be “substantially” completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 in March, but the company warned that certain potential position eliminations are subject to local law and consultation requirements, which may extend the workforce reduction process beyond that date in certain countries. Job cuts part of restructuring plan The job cuts are part of a restructuring plan Juniper announced earlier this year. The network gear maker, and one of the early adopters of artificial intelligence (AI), reported $1.43 billion in revenue in Q2, up by 13% year-over-year and up 4% on a sequential basis. Its cloud business slumped 6% year-over-year in the second quarter while the service provider business grew marginally at 1% year-over-year. The company’s chief executive Rami Rahim in the second quarter earnings call said, “I remain extremely encouraged by the momentum we\\'re seeing in our enterprise business, which delivered record revenue results and accounted for more than 45% of our total revenue, representing both our largest and fastest growing vertical for a third consecutive quarter.” “....given the digestion of prior purchases, and the uncertain timing of customer deployments, particularly amongst some of our larger cloud customers, we have less visibility, and our revenue results are likely to be pressured over the next few quarters. Based on these dynamics, we are reducing our full year revenue growth forecast. We remain committed to delivering improved profitability and still expect to deliver greater than 100 basis points of operating margin improvement in 2023,” Rahim had said.

The tech giant may soon introduce “Device Groups” to offer better compatibility within the Android ecosystem. Among other features, Device Groups will allow Android devices to transfer video calls between devices. Lately, the company has introduced multiple Android features that aim to help users by linking their devices together. Earlier, Google introduced a cross-device feature that allowed users to move voice calls between devices. Now, the company may soon allow Android users to transfer video calls as well.  What is Device Groups and how will it work A blog post by TheSpAndroid (spotted by 9to5Google) claims that Google is moving away from “Link your devices'' phrasing for this feature and will instead call it “Device Groups.” This feature will enable users to add devices to a group that are linked to their Google account during setup, or invite them later on. The report has also shared the screenshot of a pop-up that will appear ahead of initial setup. This pop-up will bring out two use cases. One of them is the ability to transfer an active video call between devices. In the image, Google explains how this feature will work. The company claims:: “See ongoing video calls from other devices and seamlessly move them here.” The report couldn’t explain how the feature will look like in action, but it may work on an app-by-app basis using the cross-device SDK that Google has detailed on Android’s developer site. Google Meet is expected to be the first platform to support Device Groups. The pop-up will also offer another use case which will be the ability to “share internet access when your other devices are offline.” With this feature, users will be able to enable or disable hotspots on another device in the group. The report also didn’t mention when Google is planning to release this functionality for Android users. However, the company is expected to make these features available soon.

Starting today, users in the UK and Australia can access over 150,000 audiobooks without additional cost, which will be available for subscribers in the US later this year. While users can choose to listen to as many audiobooks as they want out of the vast collection of more than 150,000 titles, they will be limited to 15 hours of free listening time. If users wish to listen more, they will need to purchase additional hours at a rate of 10 hours for $11. As of now, this is exclusively available to individual Premium subscribers and Family or Duo accounts' plan managers. However, Spotify plans to expand its availability in the future. Those not subscribed to Premium or the ones who are subscribed can still purchase any title they want from Spotify's audiobook library without having to pay for additional hours if they have specific books in mind.  “Audiobooks today have one big dominating player. And just like in music and podcasting, we believe that many more consumers want to consume audiobooks and want to listen to audiobooks,” said Spotify founder and CEO Daniel Ek, speaking at the event hosted in the company's New York offices on Tuesday. “And just like in music and podcasting, we’re really excited to be able to bring all the amazing tools that we built for creators and consumers alike to enable more discovery of these amazing audiobooks to the entire world.”  There is an auto-bookmarking tool that will save users time from having to repeat pages. Then, users can activate the Spotify Sleep Timer which will allow users to fall asleep while listening to their books without having to rewind when they wake up. And subscribers can download audiobooks for offline listening. Alex Norstrom, the co-president and chief business officer of Spotify, said there are already tens of millions of Premium subscribers who are interested in listening to audiobooks, but they lack the opportunity. He also mentioned that although it's estimated that 2 billion people will read a book this year, audiobooks make up only a small portion of that number.

In contrast, BJP satraps likeHere, Congress hopes Kamal will bloomThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is going into the upcoming assembly election in Madhya Pradesh without a chief ministerial face for the first time in decades. In past elections, the party had projected incumbent CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan as their face, but the 2018 loss may have caused them toAage dhamake hee dhamake hone wale hain, Diwali ka tyohar aanewala hai (every list is explosive, expect fireworks, Diwali is ahead),\" Mishra told reporters at the state BJP media office in Bhopal on Wednesday.Sources in the state BJP said that many \"non-performing\" MLAs may be dropped in the final list. The BJP has 67 of the remaining 94 constituencies. The CEC could drop 25 to 30 of the BJP MLAs because surveys have found that people in their constituencies are not happy with their work, say sources.\"The party feels that nearly half of these incumbent legislators will not be able to win their seats. New faces may be given tickets,\" a senior BJP leader explained.In the fourth list, announced on Monday, most ministers of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government were fielded from their respective constituencies. Budhni: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan appears to be fighting a lone battle these days. And most of the 2.7 lakh voters of his constituency, Budhni, aren\\'t happy about it. They feel their Mama is being sidelined by the party leadership, and are seething.Chouhan has bared his heart before them in recent days, saying they will \"miss him\", and asking them if he should become chief minister again. As Chouhan faces the toughest challenge of his political career, his supporters in Budhni are bristling at what they see as his neglect by the party.Budhni, around 70km from Bhopal on the banks of Narmada, has elected Chouhan five times to the assembly. Since 2006, people of Budhni are known as Shivraj\\'s own. It\\'s been the CM\\'s constituency for 17 years and comes with its perks and pride.But with the BJP not declaring Chouhan the party\\'s CM face this time, the voters of Budhni are angry and even threatening an agitation. When TOI visited Budhni on Wednesday, people\\'s angst was palpable, while they clung to hope that he would make a comeback. \"I want to see Mama as CM. Otherwise we will sit on dharna,\" said an agitated Ajay Manjhi from Jhanda Chowk area.Chouhan\\'s name wasn\\'t on the first three lists, leading to murmurs in his camp. On September 22, it was Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who led BJP\\'s Jan Ashirwad Yatra into Budhni, Chouhan\\'s son Kartikeya at his side. Chouhan wasn\\'t there.After the second list was released on September 26 and seven heavyweights, including three Union ministers, were fielded, it was clear that the BJP central leadership was propping up multiple potential CM faces to counter anti-incumbency.Four days after that, on October 1, Chouhan was in Budhni\\'s Ladkui when he said: \"Aisa bhaiyya nahin milega. Jab mein chala jaunga, tab bahut yaad aaunga (You will not get a brother like me. When I go away, you will remember me a lot).\"Two days later, he asked voters: \"Should I contest the election or not? Should Mama become chief minister or not?\" The crowd shouted, \"Yes,\" and started chanting, \"Mama, Mama\".And on October 6, in Ujjain, he asked for the blessings of sadhus, saying, \"Guide me. Political roads are filled with turmoil. There is a threat that one can slip at every step. Sometimes, there arise many who put you in a \\'chakkar\\'.\"Chouhan\\'s statements in the past few days have given enough hints that he\\'s not happy with the way he is being treated despite being the longest serving CM of BJP from 2005 to 2023, barring 15 months Congress rule. And he is not one to take it quietly.Chouhan has deftly turned the spotlight on himself, projecting his achievements as chief minister, and asking, doesn\\'t he deserve to be the CM again? It\\'s a question BJP will find hard to ignore.\"Ma Narmada\\'s blessings will decide who will be the CM. Wait for the right time,\" says priest Gopiram at Narmada Ghat in Budhni.The people of his constituency have seen Chouhan rise in political stature where they see him today as the \"champion of MP politics\". And they bask in reflected glory.\"Aadhaar card with a Budhni address is all you need to gain entry to CM House. Mama recognizes me every time he sees me in Bhopal or Budhni. If Mama is not there at CM House, Mami (CM\\'s wife Sadhna Singh) meets us and ensures we get respect,\" said villager Tika Ram. \"Mama never discriminated.

       " {'sequence': 'NEW DELHI: The upcoming assembly elections in the key states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh may pose a challenge to the unity of INDIA (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) - a coalition of opposition parties formed to take on the ruling BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.As the Congress gears up for a direct contest with the BJP in the three Hindi heartland states, which the grand old party won five years back in 2018, it will have to contend with the presence of Aam Aadmi Party - which recently got the status of a national party and is determined to expand its base. The Congress and the AAP are allies in the anti-BJP front. However, as political rivals in several states the two parties share an uneasy relation.Assembly elections in Mizoram, Chhattisgarh, MP, Rajasthan and Telangana: Watch the complete scheduleFor the Congress, victory in these states will give the party an edge and also greater bargaining power in the opposition space. The Congress has government in four states as of now - Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, while the AAP is in power in two states - Delhi and Punjab.Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have traditionally seen a direct contest between the BJP and the Congress. In Chhattisgarh, however, some tribal-based regional parties have strong pockets of influence impacting the prospects of the two main contenders.Arvind Kejriwal has already announced that AAP will contest in all the three states. Soon after the Election Commission announced the poll schedule, Kejriwal said, \"We are prepared to contest the elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh with full strength.\"In fact, AAP leaders including Kejriwal have gone all out to target the Congress governments in the two poll-bound states. In Chhattisgarh, Kejriwal slammed the condition of government schools under the Congress rule and cited the success of his Delhi model. The AAP has also announced 10 \"guarantees\" which included Rs 3,000 monthly allowance for the unemployed, a monthly \"samman rashi\" assistance for women, free electricity, free school education, mohalla clinics.In the 2018 assembly polls, the AAP had fielded 85 candidates in Chhattisgarh. However, all of them ended up losing their deposits. In Rajasthan also, Kejriwal has promised several guarantees and sought votes to make a new Rajasthan - free of corruption. Kejriwal attacked Congress chief minister Ashok Gehlot for not taking any action against BJP\\'s Vasundhara Raje over corruption charges.“Their leader Sachin Pilot got tired of raising the issue, demanding action but Gehlot did nothing. If you want politics of friendship then vote for them (Congress-BJP) but if want politics of patriotism then vote for AAP,” he said.AAP leaders have been campaigning aggressively with poll guarantees in Madhya Pradesh also as they try to create space for the party in the poll-bound state. Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann, in one of his rallies, urged the people of Madhya Pradesh not to vote for the BJP or the Congress, alleging that they have entered into a deal to loot the public for five years each. The AAP is focusing on the Vindhya region of the state as it has won the Singrauli\\'s mayoral post in the last local bodies elections and cornered a sizable number of votes in the region. Before the announcement of the assembly poll dates, both Kejriwal and Mann have addressed meetings in the Vindhya region.The Congress leaders have reacted sharply to AAP attacks in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. However, the top party leadership has evaded any direct comments on the issue. It is still not clear if the two parties will enter into an alliance for the state polls. When asked if AAP will contest assembly elections as part of the INDIA bloc, Kejriwal said \"whatever happens will be apprised\".Perhaps, the aggressive AAP foray in the three states where the Congress has huge stakes could be a pressure tactic to ensure that the grand old party agrees to recognise AAP as the dominant force in Delhi and Punjab.However, if the alliance talks fail and AAP contests alone, it will be interesting to see which of the two main players - the BJP or the Congress - is impacted more.',\n",

The government machinery has failed to stop illegal operations of the liquor mafia.\"Threat of starvation is looming over families of those killed in the hooch tragedy. On the top of that, the chief minister of state is saying \\'Jo Piyega Wo Marega\\'. The state government refused to give compensation to the dependents of the victims. What is the fault of the families which lost their breadwinners.\"Anand said: \"The state government is claiming that only 42 deaths occurred due to hooch, which means that the authorities have conducted post-mortem examinations of only 42 bodies. The local villages claimed over 200 persons lost their lives in the tragedy and were cremated near railway lines, adjoining to roads and other places as they were allegedly pressurised by local police.\"What happened to those victims who were not recognised by the state government? Many of the victims did not have the money to cremate the bodies. The state government, which used to provide Rs 3,000 to the families who could not afford cremation of the bodies under Kabir Antesthi Yojana, did not even gave that to the families of hooch tragedy victims.\"The Nitish Kumar government is hiding the numbers. It is a clear violation of human rights and hence NHRC is investigating the incident to find out the actual numbers of deceased,\" he said.\"CM Nitish Kumar, Tejashwi Yadav and other leaders of grand alliance are alleging that why NHRC team did not go to Gujarat, MP, Haryana and Karnataka? Comparing hooch tragedies in other states with the one in Bihar is not justified. The Bihar government should accept its failure.\"Sources said that NHRC teams have prepared the list of deceased who were sole bread earners of their respective families, their financial status, number of children who lost their fathers and now reached a stage of starvation.Abhishek Jha, the national spokesperson of JD(U) told IANS: \"NHRC has a basic principle to protect human right violation in the country. In Bihar, there is no such violation of human rights. Hence, its investigation is not needed here.\"\"BJP in the last eight years has used constitutional bodies for its vested interest. Why has it not gone in other states where massive tragedies had happened in the past. It is an effort to build an atmosphere against the grand alliance government in Bihar and prepare a ground for future elections,\" Jha said.RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari told IANS: \"Everyone knows how the BJP misuses constitutional institutions for its political interests. The Narendra Modi government has been using CBI, ED, Income tax and other authorities to target political opponents.\"The NHRC investigation is underway on the same line to defame the Bihar government. It could be a bigger plan to declare that human right violation is taking place at a big scale and plan a roadmap for imposing the President\\'s Rule in the state.\"Jagadanand Singh, the state president of RJD, told IANS that he will comment on the issue only after the NHRC\\'s report appears in public domain.The Nitish Kumar government is firm on not giving the compensations to those who violated the liquor prohibition norms.In what appears to be an image building effort, for the last couple of days, Tejashwi Yadav can be seen distributing blankets to people in night shelters or those sleeping on roads.As two teams of NHRC are investigating in Saran, the state government is also on the toes and trying to establish the substances used in the manufacturing of liquor.\"During investigation, we have detected that a certain type of chemical was used in making of liquor. Our investigating teams have collected the samples and it will be matched with the chemical found in the viscera reports of deceased. Then we can reach a conclusion that the liquor got poisonous due to that chemical,\" said Jitendra Singh Gangwar, ADGP headquarters.\"We have arrested 153 persons who were involved in either liquor manufacturing or selling it in the district,\" he said.',\n",

       " {'sequence': 'BHOPAL: Union Home Minister Amit Shah was on a day-long tour in Madhya Pradesh during which he unveiled the Hindi version of the textbooks (three books) for the first-year MBBS students and also created a buzz when he visited the Jai Vilas Palace in Gwalior.The ancestral house of Scindia family hosted Shah for the first time after Jyotiraditya Scindia switched over to the BJP, resulting in the decline of Kamal Nath-led Congress government in March 2020.As per the reports, Shah visited Scindia Palace around 3.30 p.m. on Sunday where he was welcomed by the royal family and supporters. Shah also had lunch at the Palace. Later, he reached the mela ground to lay the foundation stone of a new terminal at Gwalior airport, which is to be named after Scindia\\'s grandmother and (late) Madhavrao Scindia\\'s mother Vijayaraje Scindia.The new terminal building will be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 446 crore. The new terminal building will have an area of 20,000 sq metres as compared to the existing 3,500 sqm. After the expansion, the airport will have the capacity to park 13 planes as against the existing capacity for three aircraft, an official told IANS.While addressing the gathering, Shah said, \"Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia Airport in Gwalior is one of the most modern airports with the latest facilities. With the dedication with which this airport has been carefully planned, I think it will be one of the best airports in the country. Under the leadership of PM Modi, there has been a huge development of infrastructure in the country. Earlier 375 km of the railway line was laid in one year, today 1,458 km is being laid.\"Meanwhile, Shah lauded the work of the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh, and he also took a dig at the Congress and said, \"Madhya Pradesh has experienced the corrupt Congress government and has seen it all.\"Political analysts were of the view that Shah\\'s visit to Gwalior was scheduled to lay the foundation of the terminal, which is the expansion part of the existing airport in the city, but this visit has several messages for the people in the political gallery, especially for the state BJP unit.\"Shah\\'s visit to Jai Vilas Palace and having lunch there would be analysed in different aspects of politics, but out of all, one message was clear that Jyotiraditya Scindia\\'s graph has increased in the BJP. Secondly, it was an indirect reply to those (Congress leaders) who were saying that Scindia would not get as much respect in the BJP as he used to get in the Congress,\" said a political observer in Madhya Pradesh.Another political analyst claimed that inviting Shah to his hometown, Scindia has played to masterstroke to give an apt reply to his old political opponents, especially within the Madhya Pradesh BJP unit. \"Defeat in the Lok Sabha election from his family bastion -- Guna was a major setback for Jyotiraditya Scindia. After he joined the BJP, he received another setback when the BJP lost the mayoral seat in Gwalior against the Congress. Now, when the state Assembly elections are just a few months away, and Scindia\\'s name is already doing rounds for the leadership in Madhya Pradesh, this visit of Shah will give an extra edge to him,\" political analysts said.Scindia was personally monitoring the preparations for the event in Gwalior for the last few days. The BJP leaders, who are considered Scindia\\'s loyalists and are the ministers in Shivraj Singh Chouhan\\'s cabinet, were assigned specific roles for this event. Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and some other state ministers were present on the occasion.',\n",

       " {'sequence': 'NEW DELHI: A day after India beat tough odds to pull off a consensus at the G20 meeting over the global challenges, BJP appeared to be setting the stage for showcasing the success as a major achievement of the Modi government.On Sunday, Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh and BJP chief JP Nadda hailed the government\\'s diplomatic feat saying it had given an unprecedented boost to India\\'s geopolitical stature under the stewardship of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, triggering speculation whether the G20 Leaders\\' New Delhi Declaration would be used as a poll plank.Read Also\\'The Fantastic Four\\' who helped build G20 consensusFour Indian Foreign Service officers played a crucial role in securing a consensus at the G20 Leaders Summit.

But the success of the G20 summit has given the claim a heft and the party may wheel this out as one of its key planks in the coming state elections and in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.The consensus even on the most complex part of the Declaration - Russia-Ukraine war - has also been acknowledged by opposition leaders, including former diplomat and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor. Tharoor though attributed the success largely to Amitabh Kant, India\\'s G20 sherpa. \"Well done Amitabh Kant. Looks like the IFS lost an ace diplomat when you opted for the IAS... A proud moment for India at G20!\" he posted on X. He also praised the management of the event, saying that the G20 presidency of India made it a people\\'s G20 with over 200 events in 58 cities.Sources said the G20 joint statement refers to \"war in Ukraine\" and not \"war against Ukraine\" in a significant shift in language from the Bali Declaration last year. Sources said the government is likely to make detailed presentation about the \\'successful summit\\' during the upcoming special session of Parliament.',\n",

It told Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati that the court is concerned about the execution of the SYL canal construction in Punjab and hence, the Centre should conduct a survey to determine the extent of work completed in the state.But, the very next day, the Bhagwant Mann government in Punjab said there is no question of building the canal as the state has no spare water to share with Haryana.What Haryana saysHaryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar on October 7 came down heavily on the Punjab Government while reacting to the ongoing SYL canal issue. Khattar stated that the Punjab Government\\'s attitude on the issue needs to change.

Noting the improved focus on skills, the prime minister informed that about 5,000 new ITIs (Industrial Training Institutes) have been set up in the country in the last 9 years adding more than 4 lakh new ITI seats.He also mentioned that institutes are being upgraded as model ITIs with the objective of providing efficient and high-quality training along with best practices.Modi underlined that India is investing more in the skills of its youth than ever before and gave the example of Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana which has strengthened the youth at the ground level.Under this scheme, the prime minister informed that about 1.5 crore youths have been trained so far. He further added that new skill centres are also being established near industrial clusters which will enable the industry to share its requirements with skill development institutes, thereby developing the necessary skill sets among the youth for better employment opportunities.The prime minister stressed making India the biggest centre of skilled manpower in the world in order to provide smart and skilled manpower solutions.Highlighting the recent figures released by the International Monetary Fund, the prime minister informed that India will remain the fastest-growing major economy in the coming years.He also recalled his resolve to take India among the top three economies of the world and said that IMF is also confident of India becoming the top three economies of the world in the next 3-4 years. Modi underlined that it would create new opportunities for employment and self-employment in the country.\"Today, the whole world is of the belief that this century is going to be India\\'s century,\" the prime minister said as he credited the young population of India for this.The prime minister observed that when the elderly population is increasing in many countries of the world, India is getting younger with each passing day.\"India has this huge advantage,\" he stressed as he noted the world is looking towards India for its skilled youth.The prime minister suggested not to waste any opportunity being created and assured that the government is ready to support the cause.Modi highlighted the importance of the power of the youth in utilizing the strengths of any country such as its natural or mineral resources, or its long coastlines and said that the country develops more with stronger youth power thereby doing justice to the nation\\'s resources.Today, the prime minister emphasized that a similar thinking is empowering India\\'s youth, which is making unprecedented improvements in the entire ecosystem.\"In this, the country\\'s approach is two-pronged,\" the prime minister said.He explained that India is preparing its youth to take advantage of new opportunities through skilling and education as he highlighted the new National Education Policy which has been established after almost 4 decades.The prime minister also underlined that the government is establishing a large number of new medical colleges and skill development institutes like IITs, IIMs or ITIs, and mentioned the crores of youth who have been trained under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana.On the other hand, he stated that traditional sectors which provide jobs are being strengthened while new sectors that promote employment and entrepreneurship are also being promoted.The prime minister also mentioned India making new records in goods exports, mobile exports, electronic exports, services exports, defence exports and manufacturing, and at the same time creating a large number of new opportunities for youth in many sectors such as space, startups, drones, animation, electric vehicles, semiconductors, etc.Modi informed that India\\'s proposal regarding global skill mapping has been recently accepted at the G20 Summit, which will help in creating better opportunities for youth in the coming times.India\\'s unemployment rate for persons aged 15 years and above was recorded at a six-year low of 3.2 per cent during July 2022-June 2023, as per the Periodic Labour Force Survey Annual Report 2022-2023 released by the National Sample Survey Office this week.Joblessness or unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of unemployed persons in the labour force.Considering the importance of the availability of labour force data at more frequent time intervals, the NSSO launched the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) in April 2017.

But their numbers in jobs are very low. To know their exact numbers and to do justice with them, a caste census should be conducted in the country,\" she said. The Congress leader was addressing a public meeting in Mandla district ahead of the November 17 assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh. Besides announcing a slew of promises, including implementation of the Old Pension Scheme (OPS), Gandhi also declared that her party, if voted to power in MP, will provide not only free education to students from Std I to Std XII, but also give Rs 500 per month to students from Std I to Std VIII, Rs 1,000 a month to those in Std IX and Std X and 1,500 for Std XI and Std XII. During its 18 years of rule in the state, Gandhi said, the BJP has done nothing for the people. It remembers them only during elections by announcing a slew of schemes for them, she said.

In a freewheeling interview with ETimes recently, he spoke about coming from a family of music lovers, dealing with campismin the industry, his thoughts on music down South and more.Read Also\\'Kailash Kher is a dynamite when he takes over the microphone,\\' says music composer Pranaay - ExclusivePranaay, the music composer known for his work in the \"Baaghi\" series, recently showcased his Indian classical skills in the song \"Ho Tayyar\" from \"OMG 2\". In an interview, Pranaay expressed his gratitude for being part of a successful film with an important message. He also discussed the process ofDivya Kumar: Music Mafia seems like a scary word, but they do exist - ExclusiveSinger Divya Kumar exclusively told ETimes about his thoughts on the remix culture in Bollywood, music mafias, his bond with Amit Trivedi and Varun Dhawan, and more.Excerpts...Many people in the past have spoken about the music mafia in the industry. Have you ever experienced it in your career so far?I think music mafia is a very strong word and it\\'s not really like that. However, whether it\\'s the corporate world or the film world, there is campism, and even I suffered because of it. Also because I didn\\'t really want to do remakes of other songs, and I wanted to stick with the original music, which was not really the flavor of the season, and I\\'m glad that it\\'s getting over and people are now ready to accept original music.Not many people know that you started your career with \\'Raaz 2\\'. Tell us something about it.Getting \\'Raaz 2\\' is an exciting story itself. I used to teach guitar to students all over Mumbai to survive as a musician before I made it into Bollywood. And once I was travelling in the train, I got a call stating that Mukesh Bhatt and Mohit Suri, who wanted to meet me for a song. They asked me to get my guitar. I didn\\'t have my guitar with me at that time so I called my mother and I asked her to please get it at the railway station. So she very excitedly got the guitar and blessed me. And I took the guitar, went back to their office and I played my heart out. Bhat Sahab just looked at me, stared into my eyes and he said, \\'Okay, your song is selected. Come and shake my hand\\'. I shook his hand, he looked at me and he asked, Who will be the first person that you tell this news to? Your girlfriend or your mother?\\' I just laughed and I said, \\'Sir, I\\'ll tell my mother first\\'.You don\\'t come from a family with a musical background. How and when did the music bug bite you?I don\\'t come from a family of musicians, but I do come from a family of music lovers. My grandfather was a great KL Sehgal fan. And while growing up, I used to sing in the school choir. And I was probably the only non-Catholic child who would sing in the choir. And then, once I was in college, I started learning music formally. I learnt guitar from Mr Bismarck Roderick, piano from Mrs Maureen Rebello, and Indian classical from Shri Rajan Santramji. And that\\'s how my journey began.What are your opinions about music in Bollywood and music down South?I think the music in all industries is very unique whether it\\'s Hindi film industry or down South. Even in the South, the Malayalam music industry is very different and the instrumentation is very different from the Tamil and Tamil is also very different from Telugu and Kannada also has a very rich heritage so I think that when you compare industries you also have to see what is the foundation of music. Where we primarily do Hindustani classical, down South it used to be a Carnatic classical but now everything is mixed and everyone takes inspiration from all around the world, not only in India so I think it\\'s a very exciting time that we are now. The boundaries have ceased.Name one latest composition (apart from your own) that you absolutely loved in recent times.One song that really stood out for me in recent times was a song called \\'Ro Lain De\\' from the film \\'Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani\\'. It was beautifully composed by Pritam, lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya and it was so refreshing to hear Sonu Nigam\\'s voice. I mean, it is just ethereal the way he has sung it. And that\\'s one song that just came like a surprise in the film and it was such a beautiful, soulful number.Who did you grow up listening to? Is there anyone you look up to in the music industry?As a music composer, when I look back at my journey on what were my influences, I now realise that they were so varied. I used to listen to KL Saigal, SD Burman, RD Burman from the film music. And I would listen to Indian classical with Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, and also 90s was a very vibrant era, so we were also exposed to the Michael Jacksons and you know the Backstreet Boys and pop. And so I think I would say pop, rock, Indian classical, film music, it\\'s just an amalgamation of everything and that\\'s what I think has led me to experiment with so many different genres.What\\'s next?Next up is my own label Thriver Entertainment. We\\'re releasing two Tamil songs. It\\'s written by the brilliant Tamil lyricist Madan Karki and then I have many Hindi songs that I have composed that are going to be released independently. So I want to create a music label where it\\'s known for good original music, you know. No remakes, we promise!',\n",

       " {'sequence': 'In the world of music, controversies are not uncommon, and they often add an intriguing layer to an artist\\'s career. One such controversy that is making headlines currently is related to singer Shubh and his canceled India Music Tour. It was an event that promised to be a grand celebration of music but ended up mired in controversy.It all started in March when Shubh shared a distorted map of India on his Instagram story. In the post, the map didn’t have regions like Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir. Accompanying the image was a caption that read, \"Pray for Punjab.\" This swiftly sparked criticism and allegations of tacitly supporting the Khalistani movement.He started getting backlash from different corners, and as it gained momentum, Shubh later removed the map from his Instagram story. In its place, he posted a simpler message that solely stated, \"Pray for Punjab,\" devoid of any accompanying visual element. While this alteration might have been an attempt at damage control, the initial post had already ignited significant scrutiny and raised questions about his stance regarding the Khalistan issue, leading to many issues, one being the cancellation of Shubh’s India Music Tour. Initially, Shubh didn’t react. His sponsors backed away, leading cricketers of India unfollwed him on social media, and he received a lot of flake. Finally, the artist has broken his silence over the matter. Taking to his social media story he wrote that as a young artist from Punjab, it was his dream to pin his music on the global map. However, the recent events have left him in a state of grief and he wishes to express himself.He confessed to being excited about the whole tour, and talked about the preparation, but unfortunately, fate had other plans. He further quoted that India is his country too, as he was born here. He expressed that he is proud to be a Punjabi and whatever he is today, he owes that to his land.Check out Shubh’s post on the India Tour controversy here:On the one hand, where a segment of the internet and many other people stood against Shubh, many artists from the Punjabi entertainment world showed their support for the artist.Sidhu Moose Wala’s team posted a story on the late singer’s official handle. The post mentioned that the hatred among the Sikh community is rising day by day. Without any substantial evidence, Sidhu was called a terrorist, and the same things are being done with Shubh as well.Here’s the exact post shared by Sidhu Moose Wala’s teamSimilarly, the ‘Qismat’ fame director Jagdeep Sidhu showed his support. He too shared a story for Shubh. He simply stated to stop promoting hate; and stop converting the innocent feelings of the artist into something else.Check out Jagdeep Sidhu’s post here:AP Dhillon who usually stays away from social media negativity also came in support of Shubh and wrote a beautiful story for him. He said public figures are being used as chess pieces for promoting agendas, and thus, as an artist, it becomes difficult to focus on the craft.Here’s AP Dhillon’s post:',\n",

       " {'sequence': 'Having scored music for Bombay Boys, Kangana Ranaut-starrer ‘Dhaakad’, Netflix\\'s series \\'Choona\\', \\'Snip\\', \\'White Noise\\', and album \\'Voyage\\' to name a few, Musician Dhruv Ghanekar who has performed and recorded with many contemporary musicians from across the globe, now announces his new label Wah Wah Records will be an extension of Wah Wah Music - the award-winning music production house, based out of Mumbai, India.The Music composer, songwriter, producer and renowned guitar player Dhruv along with the music maestros Ashutosh Phatak and Kailash Kher came up with their upcoming music video titled \\'Summertime Rocks\\' which will release on October 11, under the album Smoke Signals - a ten-track album that showcases diverse range of musical styles and influences.Dhruv shared, \"Summertime Rocks is part of the album Smoke Signals - the project that I produced with Ashu many moons ago. At that time the indie music scene was in its infancy. Since then Ashu, Kailash and myself have had incredible careers. We have all matured as musicians yet we all still possess the childlike enthusiasm of our younger selves. The song speaks of the innocence of that period of our lives when we were starting out. It was also the period when we were setting up Blue Frog and that Summer of breaking out into the world. So you could say that Summertime Rocks is a coming-of-age song that speaks from the heart!\"Describing his working experience while creating the music video with Ashu and Kailesh, he says, \"Summertime Rocks was composed and written in a day or so, I believe. Like all creative processes, someone has to always be ready to record the ideas as they happen! That was my responsibility. Ashu came up with the line Summertime Rocks and we started jamming on the idea. Midway through the verse, we felt the song needed another voice. We used to jam very often with Kailash in those days, so we called him, and he was in the studio the same afternoon. Within a few minutes, he came up with the first line: “Har pal jaata hai zindagi say, toh qyun na jeele khushi say…”, which was the perfect “sawaal” to set up the line: “Cos it\\'s the Summertime and its Rocks.”Talking about the whole idea behind Wah Wah Records, he mentioned, \"Wah Wah Records (WWR) is a culmination of my two-decade-long journey in the music business. I have produced music across various mediums- Films, theatre, advertising, documentaries, TV, Web Series and also my own music. Along the way, I have also co-founded blueFrog, performed and toured all over the world. It’s been an incredible journey and now it\\'s time to give back to the music fraternity that I have been a part of. We start out with Smoke Signals, then follow up with White Noise - an OST soundtrack that I also co-produced with Ashu. Mumbai Star - is the next one - a Bollywood-style musical that is touring Japan in November and December.\"When quizzed about how he strikes a balance between composing for a film and independent music, Dhruv stated, \"Whenever you are called to produce music for a film, there are various forces at play. You must navigate the director\\'s vision, the producer\\'s commercial concerns, and the lead actor\\'s preferences on voice while infusing your own perspective. Experience helps, but it\\'s important to retain the irreverence and spontaneity of youth. Creating your own music offers more freedom, but you must wear all the hats: CEO, CFO, marketing manager, etc. The responsibilities are multifold, but I\\'ve learned to compartmentalize and wake up early to get everything done.\"',\n",

However, when Uttam Kumar’s Hindi film ‘Choti Si Mulakat’ failed to impress the audiences, Kapoor voiced his concerns candidly. He felt that Uttam Kumar should have never attempted to fill his shoes, advising that he was best suited for Bengali classics. According to Kapoor, Hindi cinema could not possibly do justice to the exceptional talent that was Uttam Kumar.  Uttam Kumar, revered as Bengal’s king of hearts, ambitiously ventured into Bombay’s film industry with \"Chhoti Si Mulaqat\" in 1967. Produced under his own banner, \\'Our Movies,\\' and with his brother Tarun Kumar serving as the executive producer, the film had a lot riding on it. It was based on a revered story by Ashapurna Devi, titled ‘Agni Pariksha’, and was essentially a remake of a 1954 film of the same name. That earlier film had cemented Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen as the quintessential romantic pair in Bengali cinema. For the 1967 venture, the screenplay was penned by Sachin Bhowmick and the dialogues by Abrar Alvi, under the direction of Alo Sirkar and cinematography by Kanai Dey. The music was scored by the legendary Shankar Jaikishan, and featured lyrics by Hasrat Jaipuri and Shailendra. With playback by iconic singers like Rafi, Lata Mangeshkar, Suman Kalyanpur, and Asha Bhosle, it was no surprise that the film’s music became a hit. Uttam Kumar was paired with Vyjayanthimala, a leading actress of that era, and was supported by an impressive ensemble cast, including Shashikala, Rajendra Nath, and Tarun Bose.  However, the film failed to resonate with audiences outside Bengal, which was a crushing disappointment. There’s been speculation that had Uttam Kumar opted for a Bombay-based director, perhaps someone like Shakti Samanta, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Asit Sen, or even Pramod Chakravorty, the film might have fared differently.',\n",

       " {'sequence': 'Ludhiana: Apart from lodging six FIRs against a “fraud” travel agent, who was arrested by crime investigation agency (CIA) II on August 31, the police are probing 30 more complaints received against him, among which 10 are from the police personnel of different ranks. The CIA-II arrested Chirag Kapoor (33) of Gori Apartment in Chander Nager, who was wanted in five cases of fraud. The police had also recovered 20 passports, an SUV, and some documents from his possession. During the interrogation, the police found that the accused is still trying to convince the complainants to not lodge an FIR against him and rather give him time to arrange the visa or money.Inspector Beant Juneja, in-charge CIA-II, said earlier, Kapoor only had a ticketing licence. “He had links with agents and through them, he sent many people abroad. However, when lockdown was imposed due to Covid-19 and the processing of all visa-related files were stopped, he could not arrange visas for people from who he had taken money. Some of them then filed complaints against him. But one thing is sure that he never had a license required for sending people abroad,” he added.“We have at least 30 more complaints pending against him, which are being verified as according to Kapoor, those files are still in process. Some complainants, who are cops, visited us to meet Chirag. They wanted cases to be registered against him, however, Chirag convinced them to wait for some time. At first, the police will verify the fact and only then more cases may be registered against him,” the cop said.On asking how Kapoor got so many cops to fall into prey, Juneja said initially, Chirag had got some cops and their kins visas. His name was spread through word of mouth and therefore people, including police officials, approached him to get visas. ',\n",

       " {'sequence': 'BENGALURU: Much like other civic agencies that seldom stick to project deadlines, the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) too has been dragging its feet on executing work on a crucial project that will reduce distance between east Bengaluru and Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) and take the pressure off inner city roads.In 2020, the state government entrusted the agency with the task of constructing an alternative road to KIA from Budigere-Hoskote Cross Road, the aim being to decongesting city roads. Designed for vehicles to move at 80-100 kmph speed, the project was to benefit people living in Whitefield, KR Pura, Hoskote and eastern parts of Bengaluru.It has been over three years now but the agency is still buying time to complete the project. The total length of the four-lane road is 20km. The project cost was estimated at Rs 254 crore.MD of KRDCL, Lingamurthy G, blamed delay in land acquisition, shifting of utilities and clearance from the forest department for the tardy progress. Incomplete construction work on several stretches is only causing hardship to motorists. Chandrashekar Gowda, a taxi driver who often uses the road, said: “At present, people commuting from Whitefield and eastern parts of the city take the congested Outer Ring Road (ORR) stretch to reach the airport. Traffic gridlocks at Tin Factory, Kasturi Nagar, Nagawara and Hebbal make them very anxious about making it on time. Had the authorities completed this road, they could have avoided busy roads in city limits.” Manjunath Prasad, a resident of Budigere, said: “After the state government announced this project, a lot of residential projects and commercial establishments have come up in the area. Early completion of the road project will provide relief to not just those travelling to the airport, but also benefit villagers.” Prasad highlighted how lack of streetlights on the road posed risk for motorists at night. The alignment of the road starts from Hoskote-Budigere Cross and goes via Budigere-Singahalli Road and Mylanahalli. After Mylanahalli, the alignment gets integrated with the existing road located on the southern side of the airport. Air passengers will be able to reach KIA via the existing alternative road from Begur junction (Galamma Circle). Once the road is developed, the airport will be about 36km from Whitefield, 34from KR Pura and and 30km from Hoskote. But taking the ORR means people from these areas don’t just travel 20km extra, but also lose a lot of time at the busy junctions. ',\n",

       " {'sequence': \"Raipur: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and senior Congress leaders from state will travel on a train to reach Bilaspur’s Takhatpur for a public event on Monday. The former Congress president is all set to travel like an “Aam Aadmi” in the passenger or sleeper class to reach Bilaspur. Party sources said Gandhi may travel by the Raipur-Bilaspur Intercity Express from Raipur at 11:15 am on Monday and return to Raipur by the LTT Express at 5 pm on the same day. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, deputy chief minister T S Singhdeo, and Congress state president Deepak Baij may also accompany Rahul Gandhi on the occasion.According to party sources, the Congress party has also arranged an alternate mode of transport by road or by air for Rahul Gandhi to reach Takhatpur. Speaking about Rahul Gandhi’s tour to Chhattisgarh, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Sunday, however, suggested that Rahul Gandhi should opt for traveling from Raipur to Bilaspur by road, instead of his plans to travel by train, in view of the frequent cancellations of passenger trains in the state. “The way the trains are being canceled, I would suggest him to go to Bilaspur by road and return by train due to the frequent delays and cancellations,” Baghel told reporters here. Thec chief minister took a dig at the BJP, saying that the railway minister is visible only during rail accidents, while the Prime Minister grabs all the attention whenever trains need to be flagged off. Reacting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagging off nine Vande Bharat trains across 11 states on Monday, Baghel said that many trains in Chhattisgarh catering to common passengers are frequently being canceled.“The trains that are flagged off are either small or have no passengers because the journey in these trains has become very expensive. The trains that used to have a continuous flow of passengers are being canceled every now and then, and the Prime Minister does not address this issue. Moreover, the inauguration of the rail corridor by the Prime Minister is not for the passengers; it is for coal transportation,” he said.Referring to the National Family and Health Survey report, the chief minister said that 40 lakh people have moved above the poverty line, with 88% of urban people using toilets. In rural areas, 73% of people use toilets. Overall, 76% of the population uses toilets, while 23% do not.He also said that the ODF Plus status has been declared for the state. “However, 16 lakh families still do not use toilets in the state. This was declared during Raman Singh's tenure,” Baghel said, allegeding a massive scam involving around 1.5 billion rupees has occurred in the construction of toilets.“Letters have been written to the central government, but no investigation is being conducted,” he said, adding that the leaders of the BJP are silent on this issue. “This also needs to be investigated by the ED and IT departments,” he added.\",\n",

       " {'sequence': 'Nagpur: Over 15 crore travelers who fall in the ‘senior citizens’ category as per the Indian Railways have travelled in trains without fare concessions withdrawn during the Covid-19 pandemic.Information obtained by Amravati-based activist Ajay Bose from the Railway Board under Right to Information Act (RTI) revealed that in the last three years (April 1, 2020 to July 31, 2023) a total of 15,26,53,426 senior citizens (men above 60 and women above 58 years of age) travelled without fare concession.The Railway Board informed that in 2020-21 the number of such passengers was 1,86,16,972, while in 2021-22 it was 5,44,48,061. In 2022-23, the number of elderly passengers rose to 7,95,88,393. All the previously existing fare concessions were withdrawn during the pandemic period starting March 20, 2020. Though the pandemic has subsided, the concessions have not been restored, pointed out Bose. Lawyer Sundeep Badana too had filed a PIL in the Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court on August 3, 2022, demanding restoration of fare concessions. A bench of Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice MW Chandwani on December 14, 2022, disposed of the PIL setting a three-month deadline from the date of the order for the Railways to take a decision. The high court order said, “Now that the Covid-19 pandemic has been abated, in the changed circumstances, it was necessary for the railways to take a fresh decision in respect of continuation of the withdrawal of concessions otherwise.”The Railway Board wrote a letter to Badana on January 24, 2023, stating that the board has examined the matter and found that the government is already giving huge subsidies on passenger services. “In 2019-20, the subsidy amount was over ₹59,000 crore. This amounts to 53% on average for every person, traveling on railways. This subsidy is continuing for all passengers. Further, concessions beyond this subsidy amount are continuing for defined categories of Divyangians, patients and students,” the Board stated.The High Court had in 2022 granted liberty to Badana to approach the court, if there is a fresh cause of action arising in the matter. In response, Badana filed a fresh PIL in the matter on August 23 this year.',\n",

       " {'sequence': 'Mangaluru: The critical condition of a nine-month-old girl from a health centre in Banakal, Chikkamagaluru district, forced a doctor to accompany her in an ambulance for a distance of 120km, to get the girl admitted to a speciality hospital here.The girl, a resident of Banakal, experienced seizures, and was immediately taken to Sai Krishna Health Centre in Banakal. Recognizing the severity of her condition, the medical team decided to shift her to a tertiary care facility here.The health centre is affiliated with Shri Krishna Hospital, Kakkinje, in Belthangady taluk. In light of this, Dr Madan Kumar G, chief medical officer of the health centre, Banakal, coordinated with Dr Murali Krishna Irwathraya, medical director of Shri Krishna Hospital. Following their consultation, a decision was made to transfer the infant to Mangaluru for further medical care.Dr Kumar G said, “ The parents had brought the infant about seven days ago for treatment. She was suffering from cold and fever, and had no other complaints. She was fine after four days of treatment, but after a week, she started developing fever. However, on Wednesday, the parents called me and said that their daughter had a seizure at 5 pm. I told them to rush the child to the hospital. At 11 pm, the child was brought to the centre after she had a second seizure. Looking at the infant’s condition, we decided to do a blood test, and found that she was suffering from severe infection. We consulted Dr Krishna and coordinated with Dr Jayaprakash of Srinivas Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Mukka, and it was decided to shift the child to Srinivas Hospital, as she needed treatment at a paediatric intensive care unit,” he said.The other doctor at Banakal Hospital was on night duty, and hence Dr Madan decided to accompany the patient, as her condition was critical. “Without thinking twice, I got into the ambulance with the necessary medicines. Fortunately, the journey to Mangaluru was smooth. We left at 12 am, went to Shri Krishna Hospital, where the child was shifted to an ambulance with better facilities. The patient was examined by Dr Krishna before we left for Mangaluru,” said Dr Madan.Dr Krishna said, “The patient was unconscious and after examining her and administering necessary medicines, she was shifted to a more advanced facility. It is a rare case where a doctor volunteers to accompany a patient in an ambulance late at night. By the time the patient was admitted to the hospital in Mangaluru and returned, it was about 7.40 am. The commitment demonstrated by this young doctor is commendable and deserves appreciation,” he said. ',\n",

       " {'sequence': 'NEW DELHI: A passenger travelling by Delhi Metro instead of a car saves almost 32.4 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilometre. Thus, a ride from Janakpuri West metro station on Blue Line to Hindon River metro station on Red Line would save about 840 grams of CO2 emissions while a one-way metro journey from MG Road station to Samaypur Badli station would save 1,420 grams of CO2.From Thursday, QR-coded tickets - both paper- and mobile-based - will show commuters the amount of CO2 saved every time they ride the metro. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Wednesday launched CarbonLite Metro Travel, an initiative to educate passengers about their significant contribution towards reducing carbon emissions by choosing metro trains, based on research done by The Energy and Resource Institute (TERI).The details on carbon emissions are currently unavailable for Delhi metro card users. The initiative aims to ensure widespread awareness of the positive impact of sustainable public transport.\"In line with India\\'s aim of achieving net zero emissions by 2070, the initiative intends to highlight the pivotal role each citizen plays in addressing the pressing issue of climate change through their transportation choices. DMRC is possibly the world\\'s first metro service to introduce such a feature in its tickets,\" said Anuj Dayal, principal executive director, corporate communications, DMRC.He added that the CO2 savings will be displayed and accumulated in the user\\'s DMRC mobile app for all journeys undertaken by the passenger, further enhancing the \\'feel-good factor\\'.For this initiative, a study done by TERI estimated the net CO2 emissions per passenger-km by Delhi Metro and five motorised modes of road transport - bus, private car, cab/taxi, three-wheeler (auto-rickshaw) and two-wheeler.\"Delhi Metro\\'s continuous efforts in environmental preservation have earned it a reputation as a frontrunner in sustainability within the global transportation landscape. The corporation holds the distinction of being the world\\'s first rail-based organisation to accrue carbon credits for innovative initiatives like regenerative braking and modal shift strategies. Additionally, DMRC has achieved significant strides in harnessing solar energy, with an impressive total solar power generation capacity of approximately 50 MwP, further solidifying its position as a pioneer in the mass transit sector,\" said Dayal.The introduction of QR-coded tickets on both paper and mobile platforms earlier this year has been met with enthusiastic responses from passengers. The app-based QR code ticketing option, launched by DMRC in June, has already garnered about 4.7 lakh downloads.\"This will encourage passengers to choose an eco-friendly mode of transport over motorised vehicles, contributing to a cleaner and greener environment,\" said DMRC.

       " {'sequence': 'LUCKNOW: Brace for bullet speed travel between Delhi and Varanasi via Ayodhya in the coming years. The train travel time, which takes around 11-12 hours at present will get reduced to 3 hours once the Delhi–Varanasi High-Speed Rail (DVHSR) project gets ready. The work has already started.The 865-km proposed High Speed Rail, commonly known as the Bullet Train, will connect Delhi with Varanasi through 12 stations including Lucknow, Ayodhya, Mathura, Etawah, Kannauj and Prayagraj.As per the project’s feasibility report, people will be able to travel between Delhi and Lucknow in 1 hour and 38 minutes.While the environment impact assessment, social impact surveys and utility identification along the proposed route are likely to start soon, the instructions are to avoid any forest or wildlife sanctuaries in the route.Besides connecting the national capital with several religious cities of Uttar Pradesh, the project is also expected to boost the real estate sector on the proposed rail route.The project will also benefit devotees who want to travel by train to Ayodhya, about 690km from Delhi, and currently takes more than 10 hours by train or road.The train will have a maximum speed of 350 kmph and an operation speed of 300 kmph. With a passenger capacity of 750, this train will be equipped with urgent earthquake detection and an alarm system for automatic braking.Multi-modal station integrationAs per the Prime Minister’s GatiShakti National Master Plan (NMP), the project will be integrated with the national multi-modal transport connectivity all along the route.In Delhi, for instance, interventions by means of foot overbridges (FOBs) with Metro stations, railway stations and the Inter-State Bus Terminus (ISBT), besides station parking facilities are proposed. Similar integrations at Noida are also proposed.At the underconstruction Jewar International Airport in Noida, the Jewar HSR station will be set up close to the airport and its integration by means of dedicated passenger walkway connection and underground roads to Metro and airport terminal buildings is proposed.At Lucknow, the HSR station is planned on the existing VIP road, about 0.5 km away from Singarnagar Metro station with which an foot overbridges connection is proposed. The Lucknow railway station will be about 5 km away and the distance to the Lucknow Airport will be about 4.5 km.The Lucknow-Ayodhya spur line (extension) alignment is proposed parallel to the existing railway line. The Ayodhya high-speed rail station will be about 2.5 km from the Ayodhya Airport and 10.5 km from the existing Ayodhya Railway Station. A proposed new road below the viaduct connecting to Prayagraj-Faizabad road will be explored.In Mathura, construction of new roads to connect Mathura and Vrindavan roads, dedicated bus facility and parking are proposed. In Agra, the extension of Agra Metro till the HSR station with parking and a dedicated bus facility will lead to a perfect integration.In Etawah, a new Etawah HSR station is planned along the Yamuna Expressway. The HSR station at Prayagraj will be 1 km from the existing Phaphamau railway station. Widening of roads and FOB connection between the HSR and railway station, widening of the bridge and increased regional commuter train services for integration with the existing Prayagraj railway station will also be explored.In addition, a water-based transport mode between the HSR station and Triveni Sangam could also be explored.In Varanasi, the proposed Banaras HSR station will be close to the existing Banaras (Manduadih) railway station. A foot overbridge connection between the two stations, parking plazas, redevelopment of Banaras railway station, a station square, a dedicated bus facility for destinations in Varanasi and integration of the high speed rail station with the proposed Metro and Ropeway Corridors may also be explored.Survey underwayThe Light Detection and Ranging Survey for DVHSR corridor began a few months ago. The LiDAR technology provides all the ground details and data in 3-4 months wherein this process normally takes 10-12 months. This technique uses a combination of laser data, GPS data, flight parameters and actual photographs to give accurate survey data. The report contains the survey of the entire route, including soil, terrain, rivers, drains and other vital information. The route alignment is planned along the existing Yamuna Expressway, Agra-Lucknow Expressway, forthcoming Ganga Expressway and the existing North Eastern Railway between Prayagraj and Varanasi.',\n",

The event was a resounding success, featuring extravagant runway shows and exhibitions. Renowned designers such as Simone Rocha, JW Anderson, and Richard Quinn deliveredThis innovative styling hack was popularized by Lydia Langford, a fashion creator, and it has quickly gained a massive following on TikTok. The concept behind the \\'sandwich\\' styling hack is simple but effective: when putting together an outfit, coordinate the color or texture of your top and bottom garments. Lydia Langford explains this technique by saying, \"When putting together an outfit, consider choosing the same color on the bottom as you would the top. In this case, instead of wearing my black pumps, I choose to wear my white sandals to complete the look.\"Watch the video here:        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by ModeSens (@modesens) The \\'sandwich\\' styling hack, while making waves on TikTok, has actually been a part of the fashion industry for quite some time. This technique involves creating a balanced ensemble by coordinating two items with the same color or texture and adding a contrasting element in between. It\\'s a fashion approach that can transform any look, adding a touch of sophistication and coherence.What has led to the recent popularity of this styling hack is its simplicity and the pleasing aesthetics it offers. The \\'sandwich\\' method employs the power of symmetry to effortlessly enhance your overall appearance. Whether you\\'re heading to a relaxed brunch, a corporate event, or a gala dinner, this style rule adapts seamlessly to any setting, making it a timeless choice. One of the key advantages of this method is its ability to breathe new life into one’s existing wardrobe by combining clothing items in fresh and creative ways, thereby reducing the need for frequent shopping trips.So, how does it work in practice? Let\\'s take an example: a tailored black blazer as the \"bread,\" creates a sleek silhouette. High-waisted black trousers maintain the monochromatic theme, providing a clean foundation. The contrasting \"meat\" comes in the form of a vibrant silk scarf tied around the neck, making it a statement piece that elevates the entire ensemble to a new level of sophistication.Sandwich styling employs the power of symmetry to effortlessly enhance your overall appearance.  Source: PinterestThis styling approach extends beyond color coordination to the realm of materials and textures.One can play around with textures by wearing a soft, cashmere sweater with distressed denim jeans or try a faux fur jacket with sleek leather pants. Mixing and matching diverse textures gives the outfit depth and gains visual interest - turning a regular outfit into a stylish and captivating spectacle.The Week In FashionFurthermore, the \\'sandwich\\' styling hack opens up a realm of creative possibilities when it comes to playing with proportions and silhouettes. The freedom to experiment with contrasting sizes and shapes creates a visual dynamic that adds depth and a fashion-forward edge to the overall look. For example, pairing an oversized, slouchy sweater with tailored skinny jeans, achieves a captivating balance that exudes both comfort and style. Alternatively, combining a voluminous, flowy skirt with a fitted top creates a striking contrast that draws attention and showcases one’s fashion prowess.Beyond its versatility, it\\'s important to keep in mind that while the \\'sandwich\\' styling hack provides valuable fashion guidance, the ultimate rule of fashion is to express individuality. This technique should serve as a canvas for personal flair and comfort. Fashion is a potent form of self-expression, allowing people to communicate their personality, mood, and creativity. The \\'sandwich\\' method is just one of many tools in one’s sartorial toolkit, enabling a person to craft and narrate their distinct fashion story with confidence and authenticity. So, while embracing the technique is key, it is always important to remember to let individuality shine through, as it\\'s the key to making any outfit truly one’s own.',\n",

(AP Photo/Luca Bruno)Earthy ItalianBrands such as MaxMara, Gucci, Aniye Records and Bottega Veneta chose to focus more on Italian tailoring along with other brands. Where quiet luxury was mainstream and garments were more towards subtle sophistication of finishing, cuts and authenticity. Brands such as Act N1 and Philosophy did indulge in all the trends we churned out above but the most targeted area was the finishing touch. Tom Ford marked the debut of creative director Peter Hawking exploring all cuts Italian for the spring/summer 24 collection. Prada was the classic match for Italian luxury which is a more finishing-centric, womenswear collection formal silhouette, borrowed from menswear and reimagined in architectural forms that reconsider the archetypal contours of formal rigour. Many classic Italian brands propose absolute freedom of the body expressed in lightweight dresses in floaty fabrics that challenge the language of classic tailoring because that’s the most significant value of Italian brands. They are known for their finishing touch and tailoring in subtle colours and rich fabrics.A model wears a creation as part of the Gucci women's Spring Summer 2024 collection presented in Milan, Italy, Friday, Sept. 22, 2023.

We spotted all the essentials in this season. Milan Fashion Week was metaphysical by all means. Cooler temps took over Milan in between the evenings, so showgoers had their knitwear game on point, including a few cosy crewnecks here and a statement cardigan touch there. Oversized blazers and tailored coats with tiny bralettes underneath are still stealing the street show along with sneakers, chunky loafers, and neon-tinted heels for a splash of colour. Milanese will never disappoint us with the pop of colours no matter what age group or gender they belong to. Via Monte Napoleone is all about smart Italians flaunting their vibrancy in fine-tailored neon pops whether it’s ready-to-wear or leather accessories. \",\n",

One of her recent sari looks styled by Who Wore What When caught our attention. It was a stunning Rangkat sari from the label Shanti Banaras. The sari was an amalgamation of warm earthy hues such as gold, green, peach, and shimmering bronze and had colourblocking hatchwork motifs throughout the body. Paired with a gilded blouse that had the same hatchwork pattern and statement jewellery, the actress looked a vision in the gorgeous sari. Vidya\\'s stunning sari costs INR 15,795. And if you are wondering what is a Rangkat sari and what makes it so special? Here is everything you need to know about this exquisite weave.Vidya Balan is a connoisseur of Indian textiles. In the picture she is seen wearing the rangkat sari from Banaras. Source: Shantibanaras What is a Rangkat sari?A Rangkat sari is a type of Banarasi sari that is made using a complex and intricate technique of weaving. The word Rangkat means \"colored warp\" in Hindi, and refers to the process of dyeing the warp threads in different colors to create patterns on the fabric. The weft threads are usually plain or zari, and are used to bind the warp threads together. The result is a vibrant and colorful sari that has motifs on both sides of the fabric.What are the features of a Rangkat sari?A Rangkat sari is characterized by its rich colors, fine texture, and elaborate designs. The motifs are usually inspired by nature, such as flowers, birds, animals, and geometric shapes. The border and the pallu of the sari are often embellished with zari or brocade work, adding to the elegance and grandeur of the sari. A Rangkat sari can weigh up to 1.5 kg, depending on the amount of zari used.(In Picture) Colourful rangkat sari with nature inspired motifs. Source: PinterestHow to style a Rangkat sari?A Rangkat sari is a versatile piece that can be worn for various occasions, from weddings to festivals to casual outings. The best way to style a Rangkat sari is to let it be the star of the show and keep the rest of the look simple and minimal. A solid-colored blouse that matches one of the colors in the sari is a good choice, as it will not clash with the vibrant hues of the sari. Alternatively, one can opt for a contrasting blouse that adds some drama and contrast to the look. For accessories, one can go for statement earrings or necklaces that complement the sari, or keep it subtle with small studs or bangles. A sleek bun or a low ponytail will complete the look with grace and elegance.Vidya Balan\\'s beautiful Rangkat sari is a testament to her impeccable taste and her support for local weavers and artisans, which she has done quite often and throughout her career as an actor. The star has shown us how to rock this exquisite weave with confidence and style. If you are looking for a sari that is unique, colorful, and timeless, a Rangkat sari is the perfect choice for you.',\n",

       " {'sequence': 'She was first seen in Bigg Boss OTT and little did anyone know that this girl from Lucknow will become the most famous internet personality in a short span of time. It all started with Uorfi Javed stepping out wearing the most anomalous outfits and a bunch of paparazzi sharing her videos on their Instagram handles. To say that her outfits were questionable is subjective, but she certainly learnt how to remain in the limelight with all that paraphernalia used in creating her dresses. She is capable of making a top from bubble gum or a dress from a trash bag. Some may find it distasteful, but if you are someone who thinks fashion is a form of self-expression then perhaps Uorfi is doing it right.In a previous interview given to The Times of India, Uorfi had explained why she likes to dress up differently, \"Whatever I do, I do for myself because all of us want to look and feel good. And if people get provoked by a dress, then there is a problem there... they need help,\" she had claimed.Uorfi has made a living out of her quirky dressing sensibility. She earns more than a lot of other TV stars or influencers. From being a DIY queen to everything in between, Uorfi has made the adage - fake it till you make it, absolutely true for herself.Even the leading names in fashion industry approve of Uorfi\\'s style now. She had recently attended the store launch of designer Amit Aggarwal in New Delhi and the designer believes that Uorfi is unapologetically herself in the way she dresses up. \"I often look at Uorfi\\'s journey as a one of transformation, that metamorphoses everyday into something new. It’s clear as day that she thoroughly enjoys the process of putting together looks and has fun with clothing. She isn’t afraid to express herself through fashion and isn’t that what fashion is eventually all about ? It’s hard to not take notice of someone who has so much fun in the process of being unapologetically themselves and uses fashion as an art form and I think it was only a matter of time she got her due love from everyone,\" cites Aggarwal.She had also been invited by designer duo Shantnu & Nikhil and Gaurav Gupta for their respective store launches in Mumbai. Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla were the first ones to dress up Uorfi in their creation when the other designers were still not sure of sourcing out their designs to Uorfi. She even played their muse for one of their campaigns. “We used her for a movie. People said ‘she’s got nothing’ but she is daring, where are girls like this? And a mind of her own and a bright mind. She knows exactly what she’s doing unlike, I would say, most of the actors who don’t know what’s happening around them,” say the designer duo.The 25-year-old cares two hoots about what people say and she is certainly the most relevant personality on social media these days.

The two nations have been talking about Aramco\\'s participation in the SPR programme for years. The talks, however, gained traction after Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman\\'s meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month. \"Under Phase II Strategic Petroleum Reserves Programme construction of two new commercial-cum-strategic petroleum reserves of 6.5 MMT have been approved,\" the Indian government said in an internal document, adding that \"Saudi Arabia\\'s Aramco can be invited to participate in the Phase II.\" Aramco declined to comment, while the Saudi government did not respond to emails seeking comment.  India\\'s prime ministers office, oil ministry and finance ministry did not respond either. In 2021, India overhauled its SPR policy allowing commercial sale of the crude to boost private participation in the building of new storage facilities, mirroring a model adopted by countries such as Japan and South Korea. India, the world\\'s third-biggest oil importer and consumer, imports over 80% of its oil needs and has built strategic storage at three locations in southern India to store over 5 million tons of oil to protect against supply disruption. Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) has leased 750,000 tons of oil storage in the 1.5 million ton SPR in the southern city of Mangaluru. India has conducted two road shows for the second phase of its SPR programme that received interest from companies including Trafigura, British Petroleum, Petrochina, Hyundai, Gulf Energy, Glencore and Shell, a government statement said. Regarding a potential deal between India and Saudi Aramco, KPMG Partner Anish De commented: \"Getting the investment there will align the economic and political interest. There is good economic and political reasons for the two countries to do it.\" During the visit by the crown prince to India, Saudi Arabia announced plans for an investment facilitation office in India\\'s Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, a tax-neutral financial service centre.  India is also scouting for land to build a 1.2 million metric tonnes per year refinery and petrochemical project in western India with participation of Saudi Aramco and ADNOC. The two governments will form a task force to remove hurdles like land acquisition, which has delayed the project, which was conceived in 2018. Saudi Arabia has committed $50 billion investment for the project.',\n",

       " {'sequence': 'NEW DELHI: India is expected to impose restrictions on its sugar exports after dry weather parched cane crops in the world’s second-biggest grower, a move that will tighten global supplies of the sweetener.The South Asian nation is likely to curb shipments during the new season that started Oct. 1, and a decision will be made soon, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified as the talks are confidential. Quotas for some overseas sales can be issued if domestic supply improves, they said.India recorded its weakest monsoon in five years and any drop in agricultural output will heap pressure on the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to control food inflation ahead elections next month and in 2024. Export curbs will squeeze the market and likely boost futures in New York and London.A spokesperson who represents India’s food and commerce ministries didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.India introduced a quota system in 2022-23 and restricted sugar exports to about 6 million tons after late rains reduced production, compared with an unrestricted 11 million tons a year earlier.According to a Bloomberg survey of 14 analysts, traders and millers last month, most said India may not export any sugar this season due to lower output. Two respondents said shipments could total at least 2 million tons.Raw sugar futures surged to a 12-year high in September on concerns around tight supply, despite a bumper harvest from Brazil, the world’s top producer. Some parts of India’s Karnataka and Maharashtra states — key growing regions — were among the driest areas this monsoon, according to the weather office.Output from Thailand, the world’s second-largest exporter, is poised to slide by almost a fifth in the upcoming harvest because of a severe drought, according to an industry group estimate last month. The onset of El Niño this year has led to drier conditions and lower rainfall across many parts of Asia.',\n",

They’re part of a larger consortium in talks for the syndicated loan to billionaire Gautam Adani’s conglomerate. Some institutions were in discussions to lend $400 million each, in what could become one of the biggest loan deals in Asia this year, Bloomberg reported last month citing people familiar with the matter. No new information was given on the status of that group of banks. The prospective deal adds to evidence that the group, with business interests stretching from ports to green energy, is closing the chapter on the allegations of malfeasance made by US shortseller Hindenburg Research earlier this year. The claims — repeatedly denied by Adani officials — caused a selloff in the stocks and bonds of group firms. Negotiations with global banks on debt refinancing stalled as some banks balked, Bloomberg reported in February. Spokespeople at Barclays, Deutsche and Standard Chartered all declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg on Tuesday. A representative for Adani Group did not offer any immediate comment.Adani bought the India assets of Switzerland’s Holcim Ltd. in 2022, as the conglomerate looked to move beyond its core business of operating ports, power plants and coal mines and into areas like data centers, airports, digital services, retail and media.

Fall in crude oil prices also helped investor sentiment, market players said.Stocks from across sectors contributed to the day's gain in the sensex with ICICI Bank, Infosys and HDFC Bank contributing the most.Foreign investors were net sellers at a little over Rs 1,000 crore while domestic institutions were net buyers at Rs 1,963 crore, BSE data showed.Brokers and dealers expect the sensex to build on Tuesday's gains on Wednesday, as falling US treasury bill yields are expected to boost investor sentiment further.

       " {'sequence': \"A 10,000 square feet apartment at The Camellias by DLF in Gurgaon's Golf Course Road has recently clinched a staggering Rs 100 crore deal, according to an ET report. A similar-sized apartment was being sold for Rs 60 crore just a few months ago, signaling a significant surge in per-square-foot rates for this exclusive address.The surge in luxury real estate prices has elevated Gurgaon and Delhi’s upscale areas to the level of Mumbai's prestigious neighborhoods, with per-square-foot prices now surpassing Rs 1 lakh. Property experts are drawing parallels between The Camellias and Delhi's esteemed Lutyens zone, home to the country's top business magnates and political elite.Amit Goyal, managing director of India Sotheby’s International Realty told ET that DLF Golf Links sees substantial demand for apartments from senior executives at MNCs, startup founders and businessmen due to its exceptional amenities and ecosystem. The Aralias, the Magnolias, and the Camellias, the three Golf Links projects, have all experienced significant price increases in the past year. DLF sells 10,000-sq ft units in bare-shell condition for Rs 85 crore. However, owners who have made interior improvements are now seeking over Rs 100 crore for apartments of the same size, making it one of the country's most expensive condominiums.Around 15% of property owners at The Camellias have upgraded from 'The Magnolias' and 'The Aralias’. A majority of buyers hail from the Delhi NCR region. Notable property owners at The Camellias include Aman Gupta, founder of BoAt; JC Chaudhry, founder of Aakash Educational Services; and the Elan Group, a real estate firm. Many startup founders have also invested in apartments in this sought-after property.At 260kmph, supercars on Delhi-Mumbai Expressway are flouting driving normsAccording to property experts, after the pandemic ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNI) look to put their money in gated condominiums instead of standalone bungalows since they get all the facilities within the premises.The Camellias, which were introduced less than a decade ago at Rs 22,500 per square foot, are currently being sold for over Rs 85,000 per square foot. In simple terms, an apartment purchased for Rs 23 crore in 2014, spanning 10,000 square feet, is now valued at nearly four times its original price, at Rs 85 crore.This trend of high-value apartment transactions is also gaining ground in Delhi, with transactions surpassing Rs 1 lakh per square foot. However, Mumbai's exclusive areas, such as Peddar Road, Malabar Hill, Marine Drive, the Oval Maidan, Worli, and Cuffe Parade, still maintain their lead over Delhi.\",\n",

Sharp spikes in food prices have been the main driver for inflation as erratic weather conditions hurt production of staples like vegetables, milk and cereals. The central bank has forecast retail inflation falling to 5.7% in the December quarter, cooling further to 5.4% in fiscal 2024. Somanathan also said that even after the inclusion of Indian bonds in the JPMorgan\\'s widely tracked emerging market debt index, the country\\'s \"policy discretion remains completely open in terms of regulation and taxation to safeguard our macroeconomic interests.\" Last month JPMorgan said it will include India\\'s local bonds in its Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) from June 28, 2024.

Chhattisgarh Deputy Chief Minister T S Singh Deo, who is a member of the GST Council, said extra neutral alcohol (ENA) for industrial use willAmong the other changes, the council decided to lower the tax on molasses from 28% to 5%, arguing that it will leave more money with sugar mills to clear the dues of sugarcane farmers and also provide a boost to cattle feed production, for which it is a key ingredient. A section of the alcohol industry, too, uses molasses to make extra neutral alcohol (ENA).For the alcohol industry, the bigger relief came as the council decided not to exercise its power to tax ENA and ceded it to the states, which will decide whether they want to impose tax or not. The clarification came after the Allahabad high court ruled that after GST kicked in, states did not have the power to levy tax on ENA. The Centre also got the same legal opinion, resulting in the decision to cede the power to the state government, Sitharaman said. ',\n",

       " {'sequence': 'NEW DELHI: Struggling to execute several capital projects and clearing payments due to financial challenges, Delhi Jal Board officials have claimed the finance department has built an administrative web around the agency, preventing them from fast-tracking development works.Officials have alleged the finance department has not only put a new condition that all DJB projects must get approval from its administrative department, but has also made it mandatory for them to get every single work vetted by it for sanctioning of funds.\"There is a pre-condition now that we should provide a list of projects to the finance department for sanctioning of budget. DJB deals with issues pertaining to water and drainage where most of the works, such as contamination, sewage overflow, breakage of pipeline, breakdown of motors and pumps, are not only emergent in nature, but also needed to be taken up on an urgent basis,\" said an official. He added that it was not practical and realistic for the agency to give a list of such projects in advance.With its borrowings increasing and several projects stuck midway, DJB has been demanding additional funds from Delhi government, leading to a special audit being conducted by the finance department. Sources claimed there were several instances where DJB diverted funds earmarked for capital projects for smaller works.Apart from seeking the detailed accounts of revenue collection, funds and grant-in aids received by it and expenditures in the last five years, the finance department is looking minutely into every rupee spent by the agency now.A senior DJB official claimed the agency has got more allocation under the head where the expenditures are less but less funds for sectors that require larger spending. He claimed the money allocated for the drainage sector has been bifurcated into \\'Yamuna cleaning\\' and \\'non-Yamuna cleaning\\' heads, leading to a crisis of sorts. \"Most of the allocated funds for the drainage sector have been lying unutilised under the head of \\'Yamuna cleaning\\' while most of the projects related to the drainage sector are suffering due to unavailability of money,\" the official said.\"There is an urgent need for re-appropriation of funds within DJB. We have requested the government to transfer funds from \\'water\\' to \\'drainage\\' as many crucial projects are stuck. Money marked for a specific head cannot be spent on other projects. But the situation is so dire that the transfer of funds is required to complete certain works,\" said another official.',\n",

The dog policy has been framed in an attempt to address this.

For pet registration, dog owners should pay Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 for renewal.\"Muzzle is must for pet dogs in lifts, parks and other public places. There will be relaxations in the muzzle rule during extreme heat conditions, like in peak summer.

Former board members have debated the proposal tooth and nail but never passed it,\" said a GMC official.\"On Tuesday, the board agreed to form a six-member committee comprising three councillors and three GMC officials to consider the proposal afresh. They will submit their report to the mayor within 15 days, following which, the mayor will take a call,\" added the official.GMC rents out 1,702 shops across five zones.Meanwhile, councillor Sanjay Singh from ward 100 raised the Indirapuram handover issue at the meeting, but that sparked a ruckus. Later, Singh said, \"The Indirapuram handover has been pending for many years, with hardly any attempts to resolve the issue between the GMC and the GDA. As an elected member from Indirapuram, we can see how it is stalling development work in the township.\"The GMC has set a prerequisite for the handover of the township and demanded Rs 365 crore from the GDA to complete pending works, but the GDA has shown reluctance to part with the amount.',\n",

However, another senior official said one incident did not signal a shift.On Sunday night, customs officials at Chennai airport seized a Burmese python, a ball python, and half a dozen baby iguanas. Both python species are in great demand in the illegal pet trade. The Customs officials sent the consignment back to its place of origin.Conservationists complain that the illegal pet trade is flourishing because smugglers go off scot-free. The Union government made amendments to the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, recently to include some of the species that are covered under the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species (CITES). Despite that the wildlife trade is thriving, they say.With increased checks at airports across the country, the smugglers are transporting exotic pets by road. Recently, a large number of star tortoises were seized from a person, when he attempted to smuggle them out of the country through the Myanmar border.',\n",

However, in Ranchi, officials said only eight-10 pet shops and dog breeding centres are currently registered with the district animal welfare board, contrary to the high presence of such centres across the city.Kumar said, “The trend of poor registration is prevalent across the state. One has to pay a fee of Rs 5,000 for registration. The proceeds will go to the animal welfare board,” he said.One of the shop owners in Morabadi unwilling to be identified said that he wasn’t aware about registration with the welfare board. “I only took trade license with the local municipal body and have been running my shop since three years. However, if registration with the animal welfare board is a must, I will get it done at the earliest,” he said.',\n",

He has now adopted two lion cubs as his pets after leaving the war-torn country. Dr Giri Kumar Patil, popularly known as Jaguar Kumar because of his pet big cats, was forced to leave them with an animal rescue organisation in Russia. However, his love for wild cats continues, and he has now adopted two lion cubs, a male and a female aged 2.5 months from an animal rescue organisation. The cubs were rescued from the war-torn eastern part of Ukraine a few days ago. The 42-year-old doctor hails from Tanuku in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh and moved to Ukraine in 2007 to study medicine. Since 2014, he was working at a hospital in Severodonetsk as a practicising orthopaedic. The hospital shut down after the war began. In 2020, Kumar adopted a male amour leopard, which is a rare hybrid of a leopard and a Jaguar. Just before the war broke, he adopted a black panther. Kumar said the lion cubs were noticed near Donbas in Ukraine by an animal rescue organisation, and he adopted them on October 6. \"As I have an international licence to adopt wild animals and also run a wildlife rescue organisation, it was a hassle-free process with the paperwork. As per rules, I can raise the cubs for only a year. Later, they would be sent to pride in South Africa,\" he told STOI.Kumar left his wild cats with a rescue organisation in Ukraine as he couldn\\'t move his pets to his new place, Lviv near the Ukraine-Hungary border from the war-torn region in Eastern Ukraine where he lived. Dr Kumar was forced to leave his cats in Ukraine He said while the rescue organisation was shifting the wild cats to their rescue home in Russia, a local \\'occupied\\' mayor and police personnel stopped the vehicle and demanded to leave the wild cats with them.\"They told the rescue team that they would eat the wild cats and sell their skin for money. After two days of discussions and submission of documents to the higher authorities, the animals were allowed to move to the rescue home. I made the agreement with the rescue home that I can bring them back to my place after the war ends and financial issues are sorted out,\" Kumar said.In April, Kumar was forced to leave his pet wild cats in war-torn Ukraine and shift to Poland in search of a job after his funds dried up. As the situation became worse, the animals\\' caretaker threatened to abandon them in Kumar\\'s house and move to a safe place along with his family. However, he stayed back after Kumar promised to double his salary. Kumar was also held hostage by the Russian army twice - in April and September 2022 - on suspicions of being a spy. He was set free after the Ukraine army confirmed that he was not a spy but a doctor.',\n",

While pet lovers welcome the move, they want the facility to be maintained well and want the pet parents to exercise caution while bringing aggressive pets.\"Now, pets are not allowed in parks. Taking them out within apartment complexes is not encouraged. Hence, I thought a pet park would be of help. I have submitted the proposal to Greater Chennai Corporation and to the chief minister\\'s special projects wing,\" said MLA Velu.He said that walkers won\\'t be disturbed. \"The facility will be created in the middle of the park. It will have a play area for pets, grooming space, fountain, restrooms etc. A pet consultant firm will operate and maintain it. They will rope in experts to give dogs exercises,\" he said.The park will be set up under the Namakku Naame scheme. \"We will hold workshops to promote responsible pet ownership and strengthen community bonds among pet owners,\" he said.Bharat Varadarajan said it was a welcome move. \"Traffic and rash driving have made it impossible to take dogs out for a walk. Besides, the pet eats the food littered on the road and falls sick,\" he explained.Shruti Vinodhraj, member, Tamilnadu Animal Welfare Board, said \"This is a step towards inclusivity. It will be a first for Chennai. There are many like this abroad.

       "array(['GURGAON: The state government is planning to construct a 9km long road to improve connectivity between AIIMS’ National Cancer Institute in Jhajjar’s Bhadsa with Dwarka Expressway. The road is expected to be six lanes wide, for which the public works department (PWD) is planning to acquire around 102.3 acres of land in six villages in Gurgaon and Jhajjar. The road will lead to the expressway through Sector 102. According to PWD officials, around 76% of the farmers have given consent for the acquisition after compensation. The government is planning to come up with a fixed rate per acre for land acquisition after detailed discussion and consultation with the farmers.The road will also provide connectivity with Delhi and IGI airport via the Dwarka Expressway. Land will be acquired in Kherki Majra (17.5 acres), Dhankot (13.4 acres), Budhera (24 acres), Makrola (35.6 acres), Iqbalpur (6.6 acres) and Bhadsa (5 acres). The project is expected to cost around Rs 272.1 crore, of which Rs 206.8 crore will be required for land acquisition and Rs 65.3 crore for road construction.“Land parcels around 45m wide will be acquired from Bhadsa to Makdola, while from Makdola to Kherki Majra, around 60m-wide plots will be acquired for the proposed road. The road will connect AIIMS Jhajjar to Dwarka Expressway at Sector 102. There is a plan to construct a flyover at this point to connect both roads,” a senior PWD official said.At present, people from the city heading towards AIIMS Jhajjar have to take Badli Road from Basai. This road is narrow and remains congested due to heavy traffic movement.AIIMS Jhajjar has around 500 patients visiting its OPDs every day, who have to wait for 20 to 25 days to get an appointment. The hospital has 250 beds at present, which is expected to be increased to 700 by next year.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had in December 2015 announced that a four-lane road would be built to connect Jhajjar’s Badli with IGI airport. The state government gave administrative approval for the construction of the road in May 2017. The proposed AIIMS-Dwarka Expressway link is part of the CM’s announcement.The road is likely to start at AIIMS in Bhadsa and end at Sector 102 via Iqbalpur, Makrola, Budhera, Dhankot and Kherki Majra. For the project, the state government is planning to acquire around 98.6 acres of private land and 3.7 acres of panchayat land. It has received consent from farmers for acquisition of 78.2 acres till now, which is around 76.4% of the total land required. “The process of availing consent from the remaining landowners is under progress,” an official said.',\n",

The road is expected to be six lanes wide, for which the public works department (PWD) is planning to acquire around 102.3 acres of land in six villages in Gurgaon and Jhajjar. The road will lead to the expressway through Sector 102. According to PWD officials, around 76% of the farmers have given consent for the acquisition after compensation. The government is planning to come up with a fixed rate per acre for land acquisition after detailed discussion and consultation with the farmers.The road will also provide connectivity with Delhi and IGI airport via the Dwarka Expressway. Land will be acquired in Kherki Majra (17.5 acres), Dhankot (13.4 acres), Budhera (24 acres), Makrola (35.6 acres), Iqbalpur (6.6 acres) and Bhadsa (5 acres). The project is expected to cost around Rs 272.1 crore, of which Rs 206.8 crore will be required for land acquisition and Rs 65.3 crore for road construction.“Land parcels around 45m wide will be acquired from Bhadsa to Makdola, while from Makdola to Kherki Majra, around 60m-wide plots will be acquired for the proposed road.

There is a plan to construct a flyover at this point to connect both roads,” a senior PWD official said.At present, people from the city heading towards AIIMS Jhajjar have to take Badli Road from Basai. This road is narrow and remains congested due to heavy traffic movement.AIIMS Jhajjar has around 500 patients visiting its OPDs every day, who have to wait for 20 to 25 days to get an appointment. The hospital has 250 beds at present, which is expected to be increased to 700 by next year.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had in December 2015 announced that a four-lane road would be built to connect Jhajjar’s Badli with IGI airport.

In February 2023, the first phase of the expressway between Delhi and Rajasthan’s Jaipur was opened to the public. The new stretch of expressway, led to a reduction of 2 hours travel time between Delhi and Jaipur. Once completed, the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway will cut across six states, including Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Here are some latest updates on the current progress of the massive project. Latest development:The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) recently issued a public notice, listing the fee structures for vehicles plying on seven stretches across Madhya Pradesh (MP). The Madhya Pradesh part of the Expressway is being completed in nine stages and will stretch between the 220 kilometre 220 to kilometre marker to 720 km marker on the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, once it is completed. 244 km stretch inaugurated in MP between Jhabua to Jhalawar:NHAI has formally inaugurated the 244 km stretch between Madhya Pradesh's Jhabua to Rajashtan's Modak, near Jhalawar, on September 20. The new stretch of expressway passes through Jhabua, Mandsaur and Ratlam districts in Madhya Pradesh and will connect major cities, including Garoth, Jaora, Ratlam, and Thandla in the state.Is the Expressway between Jhabua (MP) to Delhi complete? Not reallyAccording to HV Kumar, Indian highway and automotive expert, the drive from Jhabua to Delhi cannot be made completely on the Expressway yet. Between the journey from Jhabua to Delhi, travellers will need to exit the expressway at Modak and follow the Ujjain - Kota - Tonk - Lalsot (old route). Vehicles again have the option of re-entering the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway from the Lalsot on ramp to reach Delhi (Sohna Road). Expert, HV Kumar further reported that the patch between leaving the expressway at Modak and catching it again at Lalsot, is not an easy drive. While the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway between Delhi to Lalsot in Rajasthan (South of Jaipur) has been operational since February, HV Kumar reports that the section between Rajasthan's Lalsot and Sawai has also been completed now, however, it is not open to the public yet. We can expect the stretch to open soon and offer a higher stretch of uninterrupted travel on the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway.

(We) found deficiencies in AI’s accident prevention work and (in) the availability of requisite technical man power as required in the approved Flight Safety Manual and the relevant Civil Aviation Requirements (rules). Further it was observed that some of the internal audit/spot checks claimed to be carried out by the airline were done in a perfunctory manner and not as per the regulatory requirements,” a senior DGCA official said.After reviewing the action taken report submitted by AI, the DGCA issued show cause notices to the concerned post holders. “Based on the review of the replies received, the airline has been directed not to assign any audits/surveillance/spot checks pertaining to compliance of DGCA requirements to the particular auditor involved in the perfunctory inspections which indicates lack of diligence. Further the approval of AI’s chief of flight safety has been suspended for a month for the lapses established,” the DGCA official said.An AI spokesperson said: \"We acknowledge and accept the DGCA’s finding, and regret the failure of one of our audit staff to fully comply with the process and documentation requirements.

We are sparing no effort to uplift the culture of safety and diligence to contemporary standards, through clarifying requirements, training and stricter consequence management.

Later the airline was conditionally allowed to resume their use.Before that DGCA had found AI had conducted 13 spot checks related to flight safety at Delhi, Mumbai and Goa between January and June, 2023, only on paper without the same having been actually carried out. These fabricated reports were even accepted by the airline’s two senior officials, the regulator had found. These 13 checks were supposed to have been carried out between January and June, 2023, in areas like ramp, cargo, cabin surveillance and post flight medical examination. Airlines and the regulator keep conducting random surprise checks across various departments to ensure things are in order and that safety is not being compromised.',\n",

And it would only be wise to assume that she will now be seen in more Hindi films, but it seems like nothing of that sort is happening. Apparently, the actress is not exactly happy with the way her character was showcased in Jawan, and it is all because of director Atlee.As per a report by Hindustan Times, it is being suggested that Nayanthara is quite upset with Atlee because her role was chopped in the film and was sidelined significantly. On the other hand, according to her, Deepika Padukone’s character was elevated.Though Deepika is only credited as a special appearance in the film, to many it didn’t feel that way. The source suggested that Deepika’s role was not a cameo at all and in fact, Jawan was made to look like a SRK- Deepika film. Nayanthara who is a huge star down south, hasn't reportedly taken the snub well, which is the reason why she might not be seen in Bollywood projects as something similar might happen again. However, there is no confirmation to these reports.It is also being suggested that it was because of this reason, she didn’t attend any promotional event of the film pre or post release. However, not many are aware that Nayanthara usually has a no promotion policy and never attends film events. It is believed that since she has had poor experiences earlier during promotions, she stays away from them, she feels that her job is to act and not get involved in promotions.Jawan has set the records for the fastest entry into the 500 crore club in India, the film took 13 days to achieve this feat and is already challenging movies like Gadar 2, Baahubali 2: The Conclusion and Pathaan to occupy the number one spot for the highest grossing film ever.\",\n",

       " \"Canada on September 19 expelled an Indian diplomat following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s allegations of a “potential” involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June. Hours later, India hit back by expelling a Canadian diplomat.Ambassador Anil Trigunayat, who has served in Indian missions in the US, Russia, Sweden, Nigeria, Libya among others, says that Canadian actions are not that of a friend or a country “that wishes good for you” and that they are “essentially against India's interests, which we have protected all the time”. Excerpts from an interview to TOI+:Q: Why have Canada-India relations nosedived over the past few years?A: The fact remains that Canadians have not addressed India’s genuine concerns and have allowed anti-India activities and groups to proliferate in Canada. We have seen the Khalistani movement has reared its ugly head and there have been attacks and threats to Indian diplomats.There have been protests against India including a Khalistan referendum, which has a direct impact on India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.Canadian actions are not that of a friend or a country that wishes good for you. It is essentially against India’s interests, which we have protected all the time. Canada’s complicity is really clear.In recent times, we have taken it up with Justin Trudeau when he came for a bilateral visit last time. He brought along a Sikh extremist gentleman along with him and that was in violation of India’s hospitality.When he was here for G20, the Indian government showed full hospitality and civility, but at the same time, he misused that. PM Narendra Modi took up all these cases along with requisite evidence, but that is not something that really pleased him.He also raised the issue of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, which according to reports, was [the result of] a gang war. Now, he goes back and accuses the Indian agencies of a plot in killing this person without any evidence.He then decides to expel an Indian diplomat. So the whole idea is essentially to somehow cater to his constituency and try to retrieve the lost ground and confidence among the terrorist-oriented groups there. Q: Do you think the cold shoulder given to Trudeau during the G20 summit was a mistake?A: No it was not a mistake. I mean there was no cold shouldering per se, but when a country continues to behave not according to your national interest, you are not going to go overboard to please them. We try to extend the maximum courtesy that is possible to all the heads of state. PM Modi also had a side meeting. His [Trudeau’s] plane got stuck here and he was here for four days [in total]. Had it been a more friendlier and one that is looking after India’s interests, perhaps he would have enjoyed those extra days that he was stuck in India.I don’t see the cold shouldering but definitely, there is a way of conveying messages diplomatically and that was precisely the tool that was deployed. Q: Do you think it is a blow for diplomacy on both sides?A: Obviously, these are extreme actions which are taken to expel diplomats. But if one country does it, it is reciprocity, that is evoked by another country, in this case, India, which has always been a victim of terrorism for at least for 40 years.Instead of joining hands with India to eliminate terrorists, if you pander to the extremists and terrorists, then obviously there is no meeting ground there and therefore, I guess that this was something that would send the relationship in a downward spiral rather than stabilising in the short term. India rejects allegations by Canada:https://t.co/KDzCczWNN2 pic.twitter.com/VSDxbefWLw Arindam Bagchi (@MEAIndia) September 19, 2023 ]]>Q: Has Canada always been reluctant to deal with its Sikh extremism in the country?A: They are the constituency. They are financiers. British Columbia has the maximum Sikhs and they are also part of his government. And he is being supported by Jagmeet Singh. Singh’s party [New Democratic Party] is part of the coalition and that is why he had to make the choice between his political career and his diplomatic furnace. Q: When did the relationship between both the countries start deteriorating? A: It has not been a great relationship. However, we have had a trade relationship and we were discussing a trade agreement in recent times.When Justin Trudeau needed vaccines during Covid, despite the faux pax he committed while he was visiting India, we provided around 5mn vaccines immediately.Let's go back to 1982; India wanted Talwinder Parmar’s [the alleged mastermind of the 1985 Air India bombing] extradition. His father Pierre Trudeau was the PM then and he refused to extradite him despite acknowledging his complicity in the crime.Thereafter, they did not take any of our concerns. The Kanishka crash, in which 329 people died, there was no sincerity from their side. The whole plan was hatched on Canadian soil. The Canadian government knows the complicity of these groups with Pakistan. Also, the comments he has made on India’s internal affairs with regards to farmers' protestswere uncalled for.I think it is the cumulative impact which we are seeing now. Q: What does this imply for both the countries?A: As far as India is concerned, it wants good relations with every country but it wants to cater to its own national interest and protect it.India’s economy is four times the economy of Canada. So, it is up to Canada, whether it wishes to continue to have good relations with India, or pander to the domestic constituency, which is extremist so to say.I hope good sense will prevail and they will realise the worth of the relationship. Q: Has India ever been accused of this sort of activity before? A: Pakistan keeps on doing all the time [smiles]. I don’t know.Q: How did India respond diplomatically at that point?A: You can accuse anyone for anything but unless you provide proof or evidence, it is a PR exercise to gain brownie points.As far as Pakistan is concerned, the whole world knows that it is a haven of terrorism and the groups in Canada have links with Pakistani groups like Babbar Khalsa.If they wish to jeopardise the relationship, they should read the Bhasmasur theory, which is that it would bite them eventually.Very often the Western country just to put you on the back foot would come out with human rights issues or something like that as far as terrorists are concerned. So, I think India has to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity.Q: India has rejected Trudeau’s allegations and taken a retaliatory measure by sending back a Canadian diplomat. What typically would happen from this stage onwards?A: Our diplomat will come back and their diplomat who has been identified will leave in five days. And then what happens is that the high commissioners are there.In case, the relationship further worsens, there may be a possibility of downgrading the ties to charge de affairs. It means that when the ambassador is not there in the country, then the next officer who takes charge is called chargé d’affaires.If the situation continues to worsen and it also depends on if the Canadians do not take care of our diplomats in their country. It is also possible because that is the responsibility of the Canadian government…. secondly, how it plays out in the global outreach.If there is any evidence, then provide it and deal with it. India is also against terrorism, but without providing any evidence and simply accusing the country of doing something there is nothing more than hypothesis. India expels a senior Canadian Diplomat: https://t.co/TS8LHCUuuY pic.twitter.com/Y0pXq3v1DG Arindam Bagchi (@MEAIndia) September 19, 2023 ]]>Q: Do you see Canada’s statement as a major compulsion because of its domestic policies?A: He is trying to please his constituency and his alliance partners. I think the incentive for him to go ahead and take this kind of a step is to raise domestic furore over it and this is precisely what he is trying to do – play to the gallery to raise his sagging ratings. Q: Do you see the US getting more involved in it? A: I am sure Canada must have told all its friends including the US if they have any evidence.If the Canadians do not have any evidence and are simply accusing us, I am sure the Americans would have some sense not to get unnecessarily involved in this. #WATCH | On India-Canada diplomatic row, US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti says Canada is a dear friend, partner and ally and happens to be our northern neighbour. We care deeply for Canada just as we care deeply for India. I think that moments like this don&#39;t define our… pic.twitter.com/eSUF2qnmIj ANI (@ANI) September 20, 2023 ]]>Q: What does it mean for India or any other country to be accused of an extrajudicial killing on foreign soil?A: There are countries and there are intelligence agencies. You have seen Iran and Israel. It is going on all the time. The Americans bombing Afghanistan and going to Iraq and killing millions of people, for no fault of their own, by manufacturing evidence.So I think those are the things that fall into this category, but we didn’t have to. We have been asking the Canadians all along to rein in these extremist elements.Q: Do you think India would be willing to investigate the claims Canada has made?A: There is no question of claim. If you provide evidence, we can work together. We have always cooperated with them. Q: Do you think both countries would further antagonise each other?A: I think that it will all depend which way in my view the situation takes.India is not worsening the relationship. The relationship has been precipitated by the Canadians and if they want to go this way, then I don't see that the relationship is going to move on a high orbit anytime soon.\",\n",

       " 'LONDON: The arrest of a popular businessman (a person of Indian origin) and the disruption of a Ganesh Chaturthi procession by Leicestershire police has sparked nationwide anger amongst British Hindus.Dharmesh Lakhani, owner of Bobby’s restaurant on Belgrave Road, was kept for five hours in a police cell and is now needing medical attention for the manner in which he was handcuffed outside the Shivalaya Mandir — The Leicestershire Brahma Samaj on Monday night. He plans to file a complaint with Leicestershire police.According to Leicestershire police,“an unplanned procession was found to be underway on the street”.“There are legal requirements surrounding processions and therefore officers attempted to engage with the crowd to establish the details of an organiser. This led to an incident where the man was arrested and is now subject to investigation,” it said in a statement.But Lakhani told TOI: “It was not a procession. It was 10-12 people taking two murtis (idols) of our gods for the Ganesh celebration on Monday night.”The big procession, when the dissolvable murtis of the god Ganesh, will be transported from the Shivalaya Mandir to be dipped in the water at Cossington Park, will take place on Sunday. The Belgrave Business Association, which is organising the event, has permission for that.Lakhani said on Monday the murtis were being wheeled in a “rekri” to the Shivalaya mandir from Jeram, the Belgrave Road shop which had imported the idols from India, ahead of daily puja and aarati starting Tuesday. The Shivalaya is the same temple from which a flag was pulled down during the Leicester riots exactly one year ago.He claimed a “rogue police officer” turned up and started harassing the head priest of the Shivalaya Mandir, Madhusudhan Shastri, who is in his 70s, as they were wheeling the idols down the pavement.“He kept manhandling the priest and pulling and pushing him away from the procession, which broke up the puja. He tried to pull him into a side street to talk to him but the priest felt intimidated,” Lakhani claimed. He claimed he then tried to intervene and told the officer to stop touching the priest.They reached the temple and then the same police officer arrived again, this time with many other officers. Lakhani alleged the original officer then pushed him. “I put up my arm to protect myself and he said I assaulted him and started violently pulling and pushing me. I was arrested,” Lakhani claimed to TOI. “When he arrested me, I told him I have a heart condition. I did not hit him, he pushed me. We wanted to do it with Shivalaya precisely because of what happened 12 months ago to build bridges again and every community was invited.”Leicester police confirmed to TOI: “A man, aged 55, was arrested on suspicion of assault of an emergency worker on Belgrave Road, Leicester, on September 18. The man was taken to custody and was since released under investigation as enquiries continue.”Lakhani (55) is now seeking medical treatment as the way he was handcuffed has left him in a lot of pain. “He did my handcuffs so tight and twisted one arm,” he claimed.An open letter of complaint about the incident by Shyamal Raja, managing director of Midlands Care, to chief constable Rob Nixon calls for a formal written apology to be given to Lakhani and the priest and an investigation into the police officer.Leicestershire police confirmed to TOI it was investigating a complaint about the arrest. Videos show Lakhani shouting “Tell him I have a heart condition” as he is pushed across the road and handcuffed. He later asks for water and says he is out of breath. Those present can be heard shouting: “You are not allowing us to celebrate our festival.”',\n",
       " \"NOIDA: Lawrence Bishnoi, a notorious gangster hailing from Punjab, has recently come forward to claim responsibility for the assassination of Khalistani terrorist Sukhdool Singh in Canada.

       " \"Vishal Bharadwaj became part of movies first as a music director and with passing time he tapped into his inner talents and turned into a director and delivered movies like Makdee, Maqbool, Kaminey, Haider etc. The director is now going to make his debut as a director on OTT with Charlie Chopra and The Mystery of Solang Valley which is based on Agatha Christie’s The Sittaford Mystery. Excerpts from interview:You have usually worked on plays written by Shakespeare but for your OTT debut with Charlie Chopra and The Mystery of Solang Valley, you chose to adapt Agatha Christie’s book. So did you get into a fight with Shakespeare this time around?(Laughs) No, it has been about 10 years since I made Haider, last of my tragedy trilogy of Shakespeare’s work. But yes I want to start work on his comedy trilogy soon. Coming to Charlie Chopra, I have been wanting to do a whodunit by Agatha Christie for a very long time. Actually I had taken the rights of the book back in 2019.Earlier I had written a movie script based on the book but the cast that I wanted to make it with and the way I wanted to make it, it was getting difficult to raise money for it . This project would have shut down had I not met up with the creative head of Sony Liv Danish Khan. He mentioned that we haven't worked together and if I would have anything which we can work together on. So I told him I have a film script, but he told me they don't work on films and asked me if I can convert it into a series .The best part of working on a series for a filmmaker is that he doesn't have to let go of his detailing.You and Irrfan Khan had a very close bond. Post his demise, you wrote a screenplay called Irrfan and I, which was printed in Times Of India. Have you ever revisited it after that ?I was very emotionally disturbed when he passed away. I get disturbed even now when I think about Irrfan. Back then I wanted to say something. A lot of people asked me to write for their publication, someone even asked to write a chapter on him, a book was being written on him. I wanted to speak in the language with which Irrfan and I connected, so I attempted the screenplay which showcased our journey . I then showed it to Gulzar saab and he was moved, he asked me to write more about it. It is like a biographical relationship between an actor and director and it was cinematic as cinema was my and Irrfan’s language. Writing it was my catharsis. Meghna Gulzar told me to make it into a film or something and I told her I can't do it as I'm a character in it . She suggested she wants to make it or if Aasman, my son, could make it. But sooner or later it should be made. Your son Aasman, made his debut as a director with Kuttey. The film didn’t do well at the box office. How do you look back at his journey?As a father I’m very proud of him that he chose to make such a difficult film as his first film. I think he shouldn’t have done that. Even I attempted Kaminey after I had a couple of films under my belt. It is a difficult genre where a lot is happening in just one night. I never went on the sets because I didn't want anyone to feel that I made it. I was happy that he alone was able to pull it off, people may not have liked the film but I feel he knows his craft.One of your strongest connections in the industry has been Gulzar, how do see your equation with him?I have been very fortunate, I don't know what more I can ask from life. We have been working together for the last 34 years, there was a point when I was hoping to get just one song with him and today we have done over 50 films and 600 songs together.One striking aspect of all your films has been that they are anti-establishment, do you feel it is getting riskier with every passing day ?Yes. I don't think you should even ask this question. Yes, these are difficult times for freedom of speech, but I think we will move out of this phase as well.

       " \"NEW DELHI: Team India prepares to face Australia in a crucial three-game series that doubles as the final dress rehearsal before the impending ICC ODI World Cup. With stalwarts Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Kuldeep Yadav, and Hardik Pandya taking a break for the initial matches, it's a pivotal moment for head coach Rahul Dravid to assess India's bench strength.Amidst this high-stakes encounter, two Mumbai-based batsmen, Shreyas Iyer and Suryakumar Yadav, are locked in personal battles to secure their places in the all-important World Cup squad.Iyer's fitnessShreyas Iyer, at the age of 28, stands at a crossroads in his career. Limited cricketing action in the last six months due to a stress fracture surgery has raised concerns about his match fitness. A recent episode of a stiff back just before an Asia Cup match against Pakistan added to the worries. While chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar has given the green light for Iyer to participate in the three-game series, the true test lies in whether his body can withstand the demands of playing 100 overs over the next five days.Iyer's reputation as a formidable batter of spin bowling in the middle overs could be an invaluable asset for India in the upcoming World Cup.Suryakumar's ODI aspirationsMeanwhile, Suryakumar Yadav, popularly known as 'SKY,' has soared in T20Is, but he faces the challenge of carving a niche for himself in the realm of ODI cricket. Despite having 27 ODIs under his belt, his average of less than 25 begs the question of his suitability in the 50-over format. While he may not be a regular starter in the World Cup XI, he's determined to convince the team management of his worth.The emergence of young talent Tilak Varma puts pressure on Suryakumar's position, and at the age of 33, this may be his final opportunity to feature in a 50-over World Cup.'Ash' gets a chanceAn unexpected door has opened for the seasoned 37-year-old Ravichandran Ashwin due to a small quadriceps tear suffered by left-arm spinner Axar Patel. If Axar doesn't recover in time, Ashwin could make his third and potentially final appearance in a 50-over World Cup.Remarkably, just two weeks ago, Ashwin wasn't even in contention, but now he finds himself in competition with his younger state-mate Washington Sundar for a spot in the squad. Recent buzz suggests that Ashwin, even if he doesn't perform exceptionally well in the upcoming matches, stands a better chance of inclusion compared to Washington. The prospect of Ashwin locking horns with David Warner and Steve Smith promises to be a treat for cricket enthusiasts.The absence of Kuldeep Yadav and Hardik Pandya presents both Ashwin and Washington with an opportunity to showcase their skills to the team.However, it's important to note that even if Ashwin excels, the team management may opt for Axar if he regains fitness in time for the third ODI. Typically, a small tear takes around two weeks to heal, and for a spinner, it is a less severe injury compared to fast bowlers, who require more time to recover. India remains optimistic about Axar's fitness ahead of the World Cup.Team composition and bowler workloadWith Rohit Sharma absent from the top order, Ishan Kishan is likely to open alongside Shubman Gill, while Shreyas Iyer fills in for Virat Kohli, who needs valuable game time. The workload management of fast bowlers, particularly Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, will be a key consideration given the tight schedule, including three 50-over games in five days and travel commitments.Australia, the team to beat in WCAustralia, despite a recent 2-3 series loss to South Africa, remain a formidable team. Their victory in the last ODI series in India in March and their track record of success in subcontinental conditions make them strong contenders for the World Cup. Worth noting is that India and Australia will clash again on October 8 during the marquee event.Australia's bowling attack faces a stern test on subcontinent pitches known for favouring batsmen.SquadIndia: KL Rahul (C WK), Ravindra Jadeja (Vice-captain), Ruturaj Gaikwad, Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Ishan Kishan (wicketkeeper), Shardul Thakur, Washington Sundar, R Ashwin, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd.

       " \"NEW DELHI: Shreyas Iyer's shaky match fitness will be put to the ultimate test, while Suryakumar Yadav's desperate attempt to improve his terrible ODI record adds an intriguing subtext to India's three-game series against Australia, which also serves as a final dress rehearsal before the World Cup, which begins next month. With the cornerstones of Indian batting, skipper Rohit Sharma and the outstanding Virat Kohli, as well as lead spinner Kuldeep Yadav and premier all-rounder Hardik Pandya, resting for the first two games, it will be head coach Rahul Dravid's final opportunity to assess his bench strength. The two Mumbai batters, who are quite different athletes, are battling their own struggles to participate in the most significant tournament of their life.With no Rohit at the top of the order, Ishan Kishan is set to open with Shubman Gill, with Iyer filling Kohli's spot.Ruturaj Gaikwad, India's Asian Games skipper, is in the squad more as a cover and could be dismissed after the second game as he will join the T20 team going to Hangzhou on September 28.India has not rested any of its fast bowlers, although Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj may play two of the three games because three 50-over games are scheduled in five days, including travel.

       " 'LUCKNOW: Terming the demise of 14-year-old Atif as unfortunate, cardiologists in the city said there could be several probable reasons for his sudden death.“It could be a case of missed congenital heart disease, but only a detailed autopsy can confirm that,” said Prof Satyendra Tewari, faculty at cardiology department, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences.Adding that cardiac arrest is an outcome rather than a cause, he stated: “If cardiac ailment was not the cause, the possibility of a valvular heart disease cannot be ruled out. Certain allergies and even asthma may result in the sudden death.”Prof Rishi Sethi of Lari Cardiology said ventricular tachycardia could be a probable reason.“World over, ventricular tachycardia – which is a kind of irregular beating of the heart – is linked to such events. But children dying of cardiac events in their teenage years is extremely rare,” he said.The experts also noted that an anomalous coronary artery (in which the coronary artery is in the wrong place or is coming from the wrong place) could also be a probable reason.“In this the heart function suffers drastically upon exertion,” explained Prof Sethi adding that a pulmonary embolism could also have been the culprit.“A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that blocks and stops blood flow to an artery in the lung. In most cases, the blood clot starts in a deep vein in the leg and travels to the lung,” he said.Talking about prevention, the experts said that children feeling breathless upon exertion must be examined. Episodes of syncope (or fainting) shouldn’t be ignored either.“Syncope is a temporary loss of consciousness with a quick recovery. Usually, syncope isn’t a cause for concern. Most people don’t need follow-up treatment. However, one needs treatment for certain causes, such as heart issues,” they said.We also published the following articles recently Treatment for snoring saves lives from heart disease: StudyA study suggests that using a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine while sleeping can help lower the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA can lead to fatigue, decreased oxygen levels, and increased risk of hypertension, stroke, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. The study found that CPAP treatment can prevent cardiovascular problems and should be encouraged for OSA patients. Another study showed that CPAP treatment can reduce plaque build-up in arteries and inflammation in the aorta. Increased adherence to CPAP treatment is associated with better outcomes and reduced cardiovascular risk. Intra-arterial chemo saves eyes and sight of 65% children with eye cancer at AIIMSIntra-arterial chemotherapy has been successful in saving the eyes and vision of 65% of children with retinoblastoma who did not respond to standard chemotherapy. Without this treatment, the infected eye would have to be surgically removed. Symptoms of eye cancer in children include white spots in the eye and squinting. The advantage of intra-arterial chemotherapy is that drugs can be delivered directly to the targeted area without affecting other cells. Follow-up is important for these cases, with lifelong follow-up for those with a family history. Cardiac cases at UNMICRC jumped by 27% in a year: GovtThe UN Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre (UNMICRC) in Ahmedabad saw a 27% increase in cases in 2022-23 compared to the previous year. The Gujarat Cancer Research Institute (GCRI) and Institute of Kidney Diseases and Research Centre (IKDRC) also recorded increases in cases. The low numbers in 2020-21 were attributed to patients avoiding hospitals due to Covid. The increase in cases could be due to increased awareness, preventive check-ups, and government schemes.

It appears that they have planned to \"eliminate Naidu\" in the jail by arresting him in a false case without any evidence and by ensuring that he does not get bail, Lokesh alleges. Lokesh took to microblogging website X on Thursday suspecting that a \"conspiracy is being hatched\" to harm the opposition leader in jail. Mentioning the recent death of a remand prisoner — Ganjeti Veera Venkata Satyanarayana who reportedly died after contracting dengue fever inside the jail — Lokesh expressed concern over the safety of Naidu inside the prison as there are too many mosquitos. He suspected that a plan was being implemented by exposing Naidu to mosquitos so that he would also get vector-borne disease like dengue. The TDP leader said that despite alerting the jail authorities about mosquito menace inside the jail, no action was taken by them. The opposition leader, who is under Z+ category security, was lodged in the jail by implicating him in a false case, he said. Lokesh further said that the chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy would be held responsible if anything happened to Naidu inside the jail.',\n",

Not only that, fans are sharing dancing videos from the movie and SRK himself is replying to them! Yesterday, a group of girls performed on the romantic number \\'Chaleya\\' on the iconic Brooklyn Bridge in New York and wrote, \"The craze of JAWAN at the Brooklyn bridge as Samadnya shares a video dancing to Chaleya and the people around join her along.\" As always, replying to it, Shah Rukh Khan wrote, \"This is amazing!!! Thank u for bringing #Chaleya to Brooklyn Bridge, girls!!! Love u.\"Apart from SRK, one person who is garnering accolades for Jawan is the director Atlee, who is no longer a name relegated to just South Cinema. The man has transcended regional boundaries and today, is one of the most sought after directors, where every big name wants to collaborate with him. His film Jawan is creating box office records on an everyday basis, and it still has a long journey ahead.The director, in an interview with Indian Express, revealed that all the love that he is getting for the film is what will keep him going in his career. He also mentioned that as a creator, your happiness is the audience’s love and every time they cheer, you feel happy and with every film of his, he sees the love growing.He also revealed that the expectation from him for his next is going to be even bigger, but he also doesn’t know what he’s going to do next. However, his takeaway from Jawan is that he has to do something bigger than Jawan. Time and again, Atlee has revealed that he is a huge Shah Rukh Khan fan, he said that before he directs his actors, he reads up on them, which ultimately makes him their fan. And by doing so, he is able to read the fans’ pulse of what they want from their superstars. He added that if you see Jawan, you will see that whatever fans expect from Shah Rukh sir is there in Jawan and whatever he’s not done in the last thirty years is also there. So the film is a combination of newness, and also meets fan expectations.Atlee also revealed that it was very easy for him as a fan to direct the star, as he always had the right balance when he was in front of the monitor to direct Shah Rukh Khan and the result is out there for everyone to see.He also highlighted that more than 90% of the people in the world love Shah Rukh and those who don\\'t, will be brought into SRK\\'s army with Jawan.',\n",

       " \"NEW DELHI: Shafali Verma showcased her batting prowess, smashing an electrifying 67 off just 39 deliveries as India stormed into the semifinals of the women's cricket event at the Asian Games. This advancement came about as a result of India's superior ICC rankings after Thursday's quarter-final clash was prematurely abandoned due to adverse weather conditions.With the match being reduced to a 15-over-a-side contest, India exhibited remarkable batting prowess, posting an imposing total of 173 for the loss of 2 wickets. This impressive total was primarily attributed to the stellar performances of Shafali Verma, skipper Smriti Mandhana, who contributed 27 runs from 16 balls, and Jemimah Rodrigues, who blazed her way to 47 runs from 29 deliveries. Richa Ghosh's cameo, contributing 21 runs from a mere 7 balls, served as the icing on the cake.For Malaysia, the monumental task of surpassing the 100-run mark, let alone chasing the revised target of 177 set by the DLS method, was all but impossible. Malaysia only managed to face two deliveries before torrential rain intervened, forcing the match to be called off prematurely.India's superior ICC ranking, as of June 1, placed them as the top-seeded Asian team in the competition, thereby securing their passage to the semifinals.Opting to field first on a sluggish pitch, Malaysia's skipper Winifred Duraisingam watched as her team struggled, marred by sloppy fielding that resulted in several dropped catches. Malaysia's bowling attack lacked the firepower to trouble India's batters. The lack of pace in their deliveries forced Shafali Verma to frequently step down the track in a bid to meet the ball early. Meanwhile, Smriti Mandhana capitalized on full-toss deliveries, dispatching them to all corners of the ground.India's opening pair accumulated 59 runs within the Powerplay before Smriti Mandhana was dismissed while attempting a pull shot off a slightly fuller delivery from spinner Mahira Izzati Ismail.Shafali Verma's fierce innings featured five towering sixes and four boundaries. Her striking prowess was prominently evident in the region between square leg and deep mid-wicket, along with a straight six that propelled her to a well-deserved half-century.Jemimah Rodrigues showcased her fine form, amassing six boundaries and forming a crucial partnership of 86 runs for the second wicket with Shafali. However, Shafali Verma faced a moment of discomfort when she was struck on her right forearm by a powerful back-drive by Rodrigues, necessitating immediate medical attention.Despite a reprieve in the deep off the bowling of Mas Elysa, Shafali Verma was subsequently caught plumb in front. Richa Ghosh's explosive performance in the final over of the innings, including four boundaries, propelled India past the 170-run mark.India's remarkable batting display and Shafali Verma's explosive innings secured their place in the semifinals, leading them to victory over Malaysia due to their superior ICC ranking.(With PTI inputs)\",\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: A loan of Rs 9 lakh and passion for woman also being eyed by a colleague allegedly led an employee of the Survey of India to murder a co-worker last month. Nine blows to the head with a wrench to ensure death and burial at a usually vacant flat weren\\'t all that Anees Kumar did to puzzle the investigators. He also placed mobile phones at different places to mislead the cops.As Delhi Police uncovered an almost perfect murder and placed Anees Kumar, 24, under arrest, they explained on Wednesday how a novice had almost managed to get away with the crime.Anees worked as an assistant surveyor at the Survey of India, where Mahesh Kumar, 42, too was a senior surveyor. Last year, Anees had flaunted his connections in thegovernment and claimed he could get people jobs. Mahesh had some acquaintances who were looking for employment and asked Anees to get jobs for three of them. Anees agreed but demanded Rs 3 lakhfor each person. The jobs, however, never materialised and Anees sought time to repay the money he had taken. Amid all this, both the men were also infatuated with the same female co-worker in their office.Last month, Mahesh began to pester Anees for repayment of the money. With his finances in dire straits, Anees hatched a plot to kill Mahesh so that he could keep both the money and the woman.In preparation for the crime, Anees took a five-day leave from office. In various markets in south Delhi, he procured plastic sheeting, wrenches and a shovel. He then went to his hometown in Sonipat, Haryana, where he left his phone to establish his presence there.On August 28, he invited Mahesh to his apartment in RK Puram Sector 2, saying he would give him the money. Instead, he bludgeoned Mahesh with the wrench. After the murder, Anees uploaded a WhatsApp status on Mahesh\\'s phone saying he was going underground because he was unable to pay a Rs 65 lakh loan. Then, Anees left his apartment with the air conditioner running and travelled to Faridabad with Mahesh\\'s phone. He dumped it there to mislead the investigators and returned to Sonipat.Mahesh\\'s family approached police to report him missing. A probe was initiated. Anees, meanwhile, returned to Delhi after thinking of how to get rid of Mahesh\\'s body. He borrowed a colleague\\'s key to a house located near a sewer in RK Puram Sector 6, which usually remained vacant. He duplicated the key and returned the original.He buried Mahesh\\'s body in a two-foot-deep ditch in the courtyard and summoneda plumber to construct a platform over the burial site.He stood there for about 12 hours as the plumber - now a witness for police - built the platform.The cops had been scouring areas in Faridabad where Mahesh\\'s phone indicated he last was present. An internet protocol details records analysis led the investigators to discover that Anees had last spoken to Mahesh on WhatsApp. During a search of Anees\\'s house, the cops found Mahesh\\'s car key. \"Anees told us Mahesh had visited him but returned home, leaving his car keys behind. Anish also met Mahesh\\'s family and assured them of full cooperation in tracing the missing man,\" said a police officer.Sustained interrogation backed by technical and circumstantial evidence caused Anees to accept his guilt and to lead the cops to the spot where he had buried the body. He was booked for murder, destruction of evidence and abduction.An officer said, \"The victim\\'s body was exhumed from the apartment complex. We have seized Rs 5 lakh in cash, two vehicles and the murder weapon.\"',\n",

       " 'MEERUT: The Uttar Pradesh urban development ministry has approved Meerut Development Authority\\'s plan to develop the first-of-its-kind 750-acre state-of-the-art township at Partapur, from where the Delhi-Meerut rapid rail transit system will enter Meerut city. With less than two years remaining for the country\\'s first high-speed RRTS to become operational, the proposed township will help develop the infrastructure around the rail corridor that will not only make the RRTS commercially sustainable, but also facilitate transit-oriented development (TOD) which is now a global standard in several developing and developed countries around the world, officials said. \"The cost of land acquisition will be around Rs 2,000 crore, out of which the UP government will give 50% as interest-free long-term loan,\" said vice chairman of MDA, Abhishek Pandey.The state government has asked us to work on the project in two phases. And it has already approved the first instalment of Rs 500 crores, which will be put in the cabinet meeting in Lucknow for the final disbursement,” Pandey further added. The NCRTC (National Capital Regional Transport Corporation), the nodal agency entrusted with the task of developing the RRTS infrastructure, will also have a slice of the profit, besides MDA. Chief public relations officer of NCRTC, Puneet Vats, said, “NCRTC is actively working with the development authorities of Meerut and Ghaziabad to develop the identified influence zones along the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor as per the newly approved TOD policy by the UP government.” The development under Mukhyamantri Shehri Vistar Yojana is an ambitious project that will conform to TOD and value capture financing (VCF) policies, officials added. Under TOD, rail-transit catchment areas are developed to maximise the amount of residential, business and leisure space within walking distance of public transport use. VCF is a method used by governments and private entities to fund infrastructure and development projects by recouping a portion of the increased property value or economic benefits resulting from the project’s implementation to help finance the project. This will also significantly enhance the value of nearby properties. “Land value financing is an innovative way to generate revenue for the RRTS project. Launch of a new township allows us to bring value capture tools such as the sale of additional floor area ratio (FAR) into the picture”, said divisional commissioner Meerut and chairperson MDA, J Selva Kumari.',\n",
       " 'LONDON: The arrest of a popular businessman (a person of Indian origin) and the disruption of a Ganesh Chaturthi procession by Leicestershire police has sparked nationwide anger amongst British Hindus.Dharmesh Lakhani, owner of Bobby’s restaurant on Belgrave Road, was kept for five hours in a police cell and is now needing medical attention for the manner in which he was handcuffed outside the Shivalaya Mandir — The Leicestershire Brahma Samaj on Monday night. He plans to file a complaint with Leicestershire police.According to Leicestershire police,“an unplanned procession was found to be underway on the street”.“There are legal requirements surrounding processions and therefore officers attempted to engage with the crowd to establish the details of an organiser. This led to an incident where the man was arrested and is now subject to investigation,” it said in a statement.But Lakhani told TOI: “It was not a procession. It was 10-12 people taking two murtis (idols) of our gods for the Ganesh celebration on Monday night.”The big procession, when the dissolvable murtis of the god Ganesh, will be transported from the Shivalaya Mandir to be dipped in the water at Cossington Park, will take place on Sunday. The Belgrave Business Association, which is organising the event, has permission for that.Lakhani said on Monday the murtis were being wheeled in a “rekri” to the Shivalaya mandir from Jeram, the Belgrave Road shop which had imported the idols from India, ahead of daily puja and aarati starting Tuesday. The Shivalaya is the same temple from which a flag was pulled down during the Leicester riots exactly one year ago.He claimed a “rogue police officer” turned up and started harassing the head priest of the Shivalaya Mandir, Madhusudhan Shastri, who is in his 70s, as they were wheeling the idols down the pavement.“He kept manhandling the priest and pulling and pushing him away from the procession, which broke up the puja. He tried to pull him into a side street to talk to him but the priest felt intimidated,” Lakhani claimed. He claimed he then tried to intervene and told the officer to stop touching the priest.They reached the temple and then the same police officer arrived again, this time with many other officers. Lakhani alleged the original officer then pushed him. “I put up my arm to protect myself and he said I assaulted him and started violently pulling and pushing me. I was arrested,” Lakhani claimed to TOI. “When he arrested me, I told him I have a heart condition. I did not hit him, he pushed me. We wanted to do it with Shivalaya precisely because of what happened 12 months ago to build bridges again and every community was invited.”Leicester police confirmed to TOI: “A man, aged 55, was arrested on suspicion of assault of an emergency worker on Belgrave Road, Leicester, on September 18. The man was taken to custody and was since released under investigation as enquiries continue.”Lakhani (55) is now seeking medical treatment as the way he was handcuffed has left him in a lot of pain. “He did my handcuffs so tight and twisted one arm,” he claimed.An open letter of complaint about the incident by Shyamal Raja, managing director of Midlands Care, to chief constable Rob Nixon calls for a formal written apology to be given to Lakhani and the priest and an investigation into the police officer.Leicestershire police confirmed to TOI it was investigating a complaint about the arrest. Videos show Lakhani shouting “Tell him I have a heart condition” as he is pushed across the road and handcuffed. He later asks for water and says he is out of breath. Those present can be heard shouting: “You are not allowing us to celebrate our festival.”',\n",

       " 'CHENNAI: On Monday, Lokesh Kumar was going about his business as a Swiggy food delivery executive in Chennai. About 48 hours later, the 29-year-old finds himself a part of the Netherlands support-staff as a net bowler, trying to help the minnows prepare against spin in their pre-World Cup camp in Alur.Lokesh, who has been working in the food delivery industry since 2018, was on Tuesday hand-picked as one of the four net bowlers by the Dutch side that had advertised for the role on social media. A left-arm pacer-turned-chinaman, Lokesh was selected after the Netherlands management assessed about 10,000 bowlers from India, who had sent their entries by uploading videos on a mobile application.\"This is one of the most precious moments of my career. I am yet to even play in the TNCA third division league,\" said Lokesh. Lokesh, who joined the Dutch camp on Wednesday, told TOI: \"I played in the fifth division for four years and I have registered for fourth-division outfit Indian Oil (RO) SRC for the ongoing season. After being picked by the Netherlands as a net bowler, I feel that my talent has finally been recognised. The Netherlands team members welcomed me with open arms; there was an induction ceremony for the net bowlers before the beginning of the session. The players told us: \\'feel free, this is your team\\'. I already feel that I am part of the Dutch family.\" Lokesh said he was quietly confident that he would make the cut for the camp. \"After seeing the advertisement, I was keen to give it a try. I felt that I would have an edge over others as there are not many chinaman bowlers in the country. The Netherlands were on the lookout for a mystery spinner and I ticked that box. So, I decided to give it a try.\" He said that working as a food delivery executive has been indirectly helping him grow as a cricketer. \"After my college days, my focus was on cricket. I spent four years on cricket. In 2018, I decided to take up a job. I have been with Swiggy for the last four years. I earn money only by delivering food; I do not have any other source of income. The work timings are flexible and I can take leave whenever I want to.\"',\n",

       " 'Accused of the cold-blooded murder of his 26-year-old wife Sajni Nair Jinaraj on Valentine’s Day in 2003, he taunted the very essence of justice by vanishing without a trace and evading the law for 15 long years.How did he manage this? By changing his name, his looks – and his life. He took up a job in a multinational company in Bengaluru, remarried and had two children. Tarun Jinaraj was living the dream woven from a web of deceit, until the law finally caught up with him — 15 years after the murder.He was arrested in a sensational swoop from Bengaluru in 2018, and it seemed like he would finally answer for his alleged deeds.However, what should have been the end of the road for Jinaraj has turned into yet another jaw-dropping escape. Hoodwinking the forces meant to hold him accountable, the 47-year-old has vanished into thin air after being released on temporary bail for 15 days on August 4. First, the murderSajni, a bank executive, had come home early on February 14, 2003, since she was to leave for Pune for training the next day. In the evening, Jinaraj strangled Sajni with a dupatta. He ransacked the flat at Hira Panna Apartments in Bopal area of Ahmedabad to give the impression that it was a case of robbery. Jinaraj at the time worked as a basketball coach in a school; he told the police Sajni was killed by burglars who broke into their home. Jinaraj sensed trouble on February 15 after the police sought to question him. They strongly suspected his involvement in the murder. The sniffer dog had also gone to him thrice.And so he got admitted to a hospital but fled after attending Sajni’s funeral on February 16 before he could be questioned.The escapeJinaraj shaved his head and moustache at a barber shop near the Ahmedabad railway station and boarded a train to Surat. He called up his then lover from a phone booth urging her to join him and even admitted to killing his wife for her. His girlfriend rejected him, saying she would never marry a murderer. “He fled to Bengaluru, then travelled to Gwalior where he spent a few days before joining his college mate Pravin Bhateley at his NGO in Bhopal [Madhya Pradesh],” a police official told TOI.A few months after the crime, Tarun’s father K Jinaraj, mother Annamma, brother Arun and sister-in-law Roopkanta were arrested on charges of demanding dowry and domestic violence.More about the escape here New identityThe official said, “Tarun would take personality development classes for kids at the NGO. Since he even handled Bhateley’s office work, Tarun had access to Bhateley’s personal documents like his marksheets, driving licence, electricity bills. One day he escaped with copies of these documents and used them to create a new identity for himself.”Tarun was now Pravin Bhateley and based on the fake documents, even landed a job in a Delhi-based information technology-enabled services (ITEs) firm. About five years later, he shifted to the company’s Pune office. As Pravin Bhateley, he travelled abroad twice for the company’s training programme and even bought a luxurious apartment in Bengaluru’s Yelanhalli area.“In the Pune office, he met Nisha,” the police officer added. He married Nisha Menon in 2009 and the couple had two children. He told Nisha he was an orphan and that his parents had died in an accident.He even changed jobs and was a senior manager in software company Oracle at the time of his arrest. The arrestWhile Jinaraj was absconding, the police continued to keep an eye on Jinaraj’s mother Annamma Chacko and who she was in contact with. She told a source that she has a “second son” in Bengaluru.\"The police team tracking Annamma’s social-media account found that she had actively interacted with Nisha’s posts. The team also found that Annamma had visited Nisha in Bengaluru. In Nisha’s account, you could only see her and the kids in the posts. The husband somehow remained elusive,” the official said, adding that Jinaraj had instructed her not to post his pictures. The call detail records of all the mother’s contacts were also scrutinised. The police finally got a breakthrough when a landline number flashed on Annamma’s mobile phone. It was made from a phone at the Oracle office in Bengaluru. Thanks to the call he made to his mother, in October 2018, Jinaraj was arrested by the crime branch sub-inspector Kiran Chaudhary, who posed as a tech executive and approached him at his office in Bengaluru. Chaudhary shook hands with Jinaraj and said, “Hello Tarun, it’s over...let’s go.” Jinaraj was left speechless.You can read more about his arrest here. Unrelenting, he filed 18 bail pleasFollowing his arrest in October 2018, Jinaraj was an unrelenting presence in the courts. In a remarkable tally, the 47-year-old knocked on the doors of the justice system 18 times, seeking bail in various forms, be it regular or temporary. He approached the sessions court, seeking temporary bail to deal with the financial crisis of his mother, Annamma Chacko, who lives in an old-age home in Mirzapur, Ahmedabad. He claimed that someone had cheated his mother of Rs 24 lakh, and he wanted to go there and help her. However, the lower court rejected the plea in April after the prosecution opposed it, saying that if released even temporarily, Jinaraj may disappear to evade the trial. He then approached the high court, who also rejected his plea in May.He approached the HC again, this time, seeking bail in order to withdraw his provident fund money for which he claimed he had to go to Bengaluru. On July 20, the HC granted him two-week temporary bail from the date of his release from the jail.Released on conditional bail on August 4, 2023, Jinaraj was required to inform police officials about his whereabouts in Karnataka and report to the nearest police station twice a week during his bail periodMaster of deception disappears againHowever, he exploited this opportunity to disappear once again. An absconding report from the Sabarmati Central Jail paints a damning picture. According to it, Jinaraj — an undertrial facing charges under IPC 302 (murder) at Sarkhej police station — was released on bail and did not report back to jail.The report, sent to the Gujarat high court registrar on August 23, states: “Accused Jinaraj was released on interim bail on August 4, 2023, and was orally instructed to return to the jail by 12 noon on August 19, 2023. But the said accused has not turned up as of now. The accused has violated the order of the honourable court [Gujarat high court] and absconded.” The shocking development has left authorities scrambling to locate Jinaraj. On September 18, a local court issued a non-bailable warrant against him.His sensational disappearance has dealt a severe blow to the city’s law-enforcement officials, who had diligently pursued him for almost a decade and a half before finally apprehending him.',\n",

       " \"Following their exhilarating triumph in the Asian Champions Trophy, the Indian men's hockey side will be eager to further stamp their continental dominance at the 19th edition of the Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.While India appear to be one of the top favourites to grab the gold by the end of the campaign, history and past records in the respective competition suggest that the third-ranked side in World Men's Hockey currently finds themselves as the third most successful overall when it comes to achieving the coveted feat. Pakistan lead the charge with eight gold medals, South Korea follow them with four, and India are third with three titles won in 1966, 1998 and 2014.India have finished 15 times on the podium overall, with nine defeats in the final resulting in nine strokes of silver beside India's name. Ahead of the hockey extravaganza in Hangzhou this time, TimesofIndia.com spoke to two-time Asian Games medal-winner, Arjuna awardee and former India coach, Jagbir Singh about India's chances of winning gold this time which will see them qualify automatically for the 2024 Paris Olympics. In an exclusive chat with TimesofIndia.com, the former coach of the Indian men's team not only sheds light on India's chances of winning gold this time, but also speaks in detail about the psychological difference between playing in the ACT (Asian Champions Trophy) and the Asian Games as well as the areas the Harmanpreet Singh-led side should be looking to improve in going forward.As a former player and coach, what do you believe are the big strengths of the current Indian hockey team that can be advantageous in the Asian Games?Well, the Indian men's team looks like the most confident side in Asia at the moment. They are mentally very strong and into the game. That's not only because of the current world ranking or the success they had in the Tokyo Olympics. Experience is on their side with one of the most dependable defenders in Harmanpreet, Sreejesh, and Manpreet, to name a few. They have the best penalty-corner conversion rate at the moment. The leading scorer is Harmanpreet for sure. He will be the main man. And also the attacking power which the Indian team has compared to the other Asian teams at the moment; so, these are a few major strengths India have compared to other teams.What are the chances of this team winning the gold in the Asian Games and qualifying for the Olympics next year directly?See, unfortunately, despite having the best side in Asia, India have not been very successful in comparison to the other teams. Let's say Pakistan, they have won more than India, they won it 8 times. After Pakistan and Korea come India, because I remember in 2018, there was no match for India. India crushed all the teams in the pool matches. But unfortunately, because of their overconfidence, they lost in the shootout (to Malaysia). And then, they couldn't even reach the finals. So this is something which worries me. However, I still say that India have the best chance to win the gold. This is how they should work on it and they should approach the tournament. Complacency should be anyway visible, but focus is also important. And they deserve to be the gold medal winners for sure.How different is the mental pressure that players experience in an event like the ACT as compared to a tournament like the Asian Games?A lot more is at stake during the Asian Games, not only because it's the Olympic qualification, but also because they are the Asian champions. When you participate in the Olympic Games as the Asian champions, this gives you more confidence, the team, the body language on the field. This is the difference between the Asian Champions Trophy or the other tournaments and the Asian Games.And this time it's going to be especially different because the Asian Champions Trophy we played in Chennai was at home. So playing at home and winning a tournament and then playing away is also very different. Let's not forget that we had some hiccups, we had some problems during the Asian Champions Trophy playing at home also. We have seen the women's side doing well in major tournaments, what are the chances, according to you, of the women's team at the Asian Games this time?With the variety of players, the mix of experience and youth, the combination which Janneke Schopman has brought in the team. The FIH Cup which they won and then qualified for the Pro League gave them more confidence, even though they didn't have the best outcome during this series or the tournament there. But still, I would say this Indian women's team has the best chances so far compared to the previous Asian Games. Last time, they were unlucky though, they just lost in the finals (to Japan). Otherwise, they were much deserving then also; but this time, they look much stronger because the coach's contribution has been immense. She has done a great job with the team. It's very consistent with the confidence they carry after the Olympic Games and also the recent results against teams like Korea and Japan. They look much stronger this time.Craig Fulton joined the Indian team just a few months back, what is your take on his spell so far?I would say that he's one of the luckiest coaches who has taken over the Indian team so far. When he came in, the team was already over the moon after the Olympic success. The experienced players, most of the experienced players are still part of the team, and this is one of the most combined teams. I would say, at this stage when he took over, he had the opportunity to play a couple of Pro League matches with the team. Now, he already has an existing pool of players, around 30 good players. And he had the Asian Champions Trophy where he could even test his players at the Asian level. Yeah, so far, I'm sure he is looking forward to the Asian Games' success because this is his best chance. Craig is one of those lucky ones, and this success will bring him more confidence before the Olympic games. What was your take on how India handled scoring off PCs as well as via open play in the ACT? Which are the areas you would like to see an improvement in?Well, in a few matches, yes, we were successful (with PCs). But sometimes, I feel we depend a lot on Harmanpreet. And too much dependence on one player and not opting for other variations will invite problems because I remember, in ACT, having more than 12 penalty corners against Japan and not being able to score. We struggled a lot.And even in the final also, we struggled against Malaysia. So yes, this is something which we have to be careful about. We lose focus. We don't play all four quarters consistently as a top team should be playing. Yeah, we tend to switch off at times. And in today's competitive hockey, you don't have even a second to switch off for the entire 60 minutes of play.I could see a lot of unforced errors during the Asian Championships Trophy, which a team like India with the experience they have now, shouldn't be committing. I could see some rush tackles inside the circle, some panic movements inside the defence while defending and also conceding goals against a team like Malaysia, who have always been a problem team when they play India. But still, as a confident side, as a world-ranked number three team when you are playing, there should be a visible difference, which was missing at times. Not taking away the credit for what the Indian team has improved (on) so far, I would still say that these areas need to be addressed.Harmanpreet Singh has recently said in an interview - 'We have the mentality that there is no captain,' - of course, this is a motivating factor because everyone is seen through the same lens and there is no hierarchy, but do you think this kind of statement could be a double-edged sword, given that Harmanpreet does carry the baggage of extra responsibilities?He should have made a better statement. I would say he should have said that everybody should feel the responsibility like a captain. Gone are those days when people would say that team sports need no captains. I would say in today's sport, in today's hockey, you need a captain with command. I remember Sreejesh shouting from the goal line, what to do and what not to do. He still does that.Harmanpreet is one of those very talented defenders India have after a very long time. He is very experienced, very cool, and composed. And the passing skills he has, the elimination passes which he sends for more than 50, 60 yards, not many defenders in the world can do that. And this quality player has to develop more command in captaincy. Definitely, a captain has to take the team along. But you need to have a captain on the pitch. You need to feel that captain's responsibility. And any good player should be very proud to carry that, not only to motivate the youngsters but also to showcase how well he can carry his seniors along. So while he should be open to all ideas, he should know his responsibility.Are there any particular teams that you think Team India should be particularly wary of in the Asian Games this time and why?Malaysia is one of those teams India should be wary of all the time. And I would say China, yes, being the host nation, could have some surprise punches, but overall, it will be Malaysia and Korea, which I am looking at. It shouldn't be a problem against Japan. Not that I would say be overconfident, but yes. Against Malaysia, we need to be very cautious. Also, Korea, with the conversion rate they have in penalty corners and also how they played in the Asian Championship Trophy, remain a top team. They have a better success rate compared to India in the Asian Games. So these are the two teams I would definitely worry about.What specific challenges do Team India need to overcome to perform well in the Asian Games, and how should they address those challenges?I would say inconsistency is one of the very big challenges which India have. We play one match very good, the other match we are not sure how we will perform, and this is one area which is very challenging for the coach to keep his team focused throughout the tournament. Sometimes, we tend to get carried away, which should not be the case. And too much depends on individual players also, especially in terms of penalty corners. Yes, Harman will be one of the key drag-flickers, but we need to have some punches, surprise punches in this tournament.And at no point, this complacency (should set in), I'm repeating the word every time because I saw it happen in 2018 when India scored the maximum number of goals ever in the history of the Asian Games. But we lost the gold medal which we were hunting for, even though we knew we were the best. This is one area. And at times when I read in the interviews where people say that nobody can beat India, nobody can defeat India, I would say India have to challenge themselves every time when they are on the pitch.Are there any emerging talents that you think will play a significant role in India's performance in the tournament this time?Yes, Indian team, they would be looking at Sanjay, whom they have brought in for a major tournament. (We also have) very dependable goalkeepers. Pathak is one of those great goalkeepers who is just ready to take on any challenge anytime. He is much better now in penalty shootouts.All are equally talented. Abhishek coming in with Mandeep's scoring skills, Sukhjeet and now Lalit with dribbles and the ability to make penalty corners with ease; I think overall the Indian team package is a very good combination, even though I was surprised with Akashdeep not being part of the team. But ultimately, it's the coach's call and he knows how he has to utilise the players. So it is not about naming one or two, I would say the entire team is a good set of combinations.Are there any particular strategies that you would like to see India adopting in the Asian Games? Both in defence and attack.India need to show more flow in their attack, more combined moves, fast switchovers, which they have done in a couple of matches, and so many other things which as a coach, I'm sure, Craig would be the better person to prepare his strategies.So the strategy is always from match to match, and team to team, and every quarter, depending upon the situation. So not very specific. But yes, I would hate to see the Indian team chasing goals and failing, then trying to rush.They are the better side. They are the confident side. Now they have played numerous matches. They have got the best exposure before the Asian games, compared to the other teams. So, yes, they should just go ahead.In case Team India don't win the men's gold, they will have to play the qualifiers for the 2024 Olympics. Is that going to add extra pressure on Team India?God forbid, if the worst has to happen and India don't qualify for the Olympics directly after winning the gold, I would still say that India would be there in Paris. I don't see any reason why India shouldn't be there.I would be the unhappiest person on earth if India don't win the Gold in the Asian Games because they are the best side. It's just about clicking and focusing completely on the very day. Forget about the world rankings. Forget about the best drag-flicker you had. Forget about the best goalkeeper you have or the midfielders like Hardik or Manpreet you have. You have the best attacking skills or scoring power in Manpreet and Abhishek and others.

       " \"India's manufacturing success in the global arena over the past five years has been notable and it has emerged as a winner, as per a study by BCG, quoted in an ET report. During this period, Indian exports to the US surged by $23 billion, marking a 44% increase from 2018 to 2022. In contrast, China experienced a 10% drop in its exports to the US.The study, titled 'Harnessing the Tectonic Shifts in Global Manufacturing,' sheds light on the transformation in manufacturing and sourcing across various industries. This shift has been triggered by factors such as trade disputes, the pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain disruptions. In response, global companies have had to reconsider their manufacturing and sourcing strategies, with India emerging as a favored destination.The study highlights India's advantage in direct manufacturing costs as an export platform. According to BCG's calculations, the average cost of Indian-made goods imported into the US, factoring in factory wages, productivity, logistics, tariffs, and energy, is 15% lower compared to goods manufactured in the US. In contrast, Chinese goods offer only a 4% cost advantage over US-made products and are 21% more expensive when subject to US tariffs related to the trade war. Specifically, semiconductor and material shipments from India to the US saw a remarkable 143% increase over the past five years, though starting from a modest base. Meanwhile, China's exports in these categories decreased by 29%. Furthermore, Indian exports of auto components to the US rose by 65%, and mechanical machinery exports grew by 70%.Ravi Srivastava, the global leader of BCG's operations practice said that for the past two decades, there has been talk of India's potential in manufacturing, often with a lingering question mark. Now, it seems that many pieces of the puzzle are falling into place. What sets this study apart is its comprehensive perspective, not only delving into the reconfiguration of global supply chains but also providing validation to the growing narrative of India as a manufacturing hub, he said. Looking forward, BCG sees potential for India to further enhance its role as a strategic manufacturing and sourcing destination. However, the decision to incorporate India into firms' strategies depends on a complex mix of factors, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution, it says.\",\n",

About 48 hours later, the 29-year-old finds himself a part of the Netherlands support-staff as a net bowler, trying to help the minnows prepare against spin in their pre-World Cup camp in Alur.Lokesh, who has been working in the food delivery industry since 2018, was on Tuesday hand-picked as one of the four net bowlers by the Dutch side that had advertised for the role on social media. A left-arm pacer-turned-chinaman, Lokesh was selected after the Netherlands management assessed about 10,000 bowlers from India, who had sent their entries by uploading videos on a mobile application.\"This is one of the most precious moments of my career. I am yet to even play in the TNCA third division league,\" said Lokesh. Lokesh, who joined the Dutch camp on Wednesday, told TOI: \"I played in the fifth division for four years and I have registered for fourth-division outfit Indian Oil (RO) SRC for the ongoing season. After being picked by the Netherlands as a net bowler, I feel that my talent has finally been recognised. The Netherlands team members welcomed me with open arms; there was an induction ceremony for the net bowlers before the beginning of the session. The players told us: \\'feel free, this is your team\\'. I already feel that I am part of the Dutch family.\" Lokesh said he was quietly confident that he would make the cut for the camp. \"After seeing the advertisement, I was keen to give it a try. I felt that I would have an edge over others as there are not many chinaman bowlers in the country. The Netherlands were on the lookout for a mystery spinner and I ticked that box. So, I decided to give it a try.\" He said that working as a food delivery executive has been indirectly helping him grow as a cricketer. \"After my college days, my focus was on cricket. I spent four years on cricket. In 2018, I decided to take up a job. I have been with Swiggy for the last four years. I earn money only by delivering food; I do not have any other source of income. The work timings are flexible and I can take leave whenever I want to.\"',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Thursday granted six PWD officials the liberty to approach the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) against issuance of show cause notices to them over alleged \"gross violation\" of rules in the renovation of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal\\'s official residence. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sanjeev Narula disposed of an appeal by the Delhi government\\'s Directorate of Vigilance and Special Secretary (Vigilance) challenging a single judge bench order of no coercive action against the PWD officials who were issued show cause notices. The high court relied on a judgment of the constitution bench of the Supreme Court and said it is very clear that in respect of a service dispute, an application has to be preferred under Section 19 of the Administrative Tribunals Act at the first instance. Therefore, the writ petition by the PWD officials before the single judge was not at all maintainable and it should have been dismissed at the threshold, the division bench said. It said, \"The fact remains that the Constitution bench... has arrived at a conclusion that the tribunals will continue to act like courts of first instance in respect of the areas of law for which they have been constituted. It is not, therefore, open for litigants to directly approach the high courts even in cases where they question the vires of statutory legislations (except where the legislation which creates that particular tribunal is challenged) by overlooking the jurisdiction of the tribunal concerned.\" The division bench disposed of the petition pending before the single judge and granted liberty to the six PWD officials to approach the CAT by filing an Original Application under the Administrative Tribunals Act. \"It is made clear that this court has not observed anything on merits, except the issue of maintainability of the writ petition in the LPA. With the aforesaid observations, the present LPA stands disposed of,\" it said. An appeal by a petitioner against a decision of a single judge before a different bench of the same court is known as Letter Patents Appeal (LPA). The Directorate of Vigilance, in its appeal, sought setting aside of a September 15 interim order of a single judge of the high court which said no coercive steps shall be taken by any authority against the petitioner PWD officials till October 12. The appellants raised a preliminary objection, saying the writ petition was not at all maintainable as the officials are central government employees and for the challenge in respect of disciplinary action, they have to approach the CAT. The single judge had passed the interim order after taking serious exception to the city authorities failing to exercise restraint and taking contravening steps despite an undertaking given by its counsel that no coercive steps will be taken against the officials. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra and Delhi government standing counsel Santosh Kumar Tripathi had given the undertaking before the single judge. However, the Directorate of Vigilance, in its appeal filed through advocates Yoginder Handoo and Mananjay Mishra, contended the assurance was without authorisation by the competent authority. The Directorate of Vigilance had issued show cause notices to six PWD officials over alleged violation of rules in the renovation of Kejriwal\\'s official residence. The notices issued to the chief engineers concerned and other PWD officials asked them to explain their actions. The single judge of the high court had passed the order shielding the six Public Works Department (PWD) officials from coercive action while hearing their petition, filed through senior advocate Mohit Mathur, seeking quashing of the show cause notices issued to them on June 19 by the Special Secretary (Vigilance) on the ground that they were issued by the top officer \"without jurisdiction and competence, with premeditation and with closed mind in complete abuse of the process of law\". It said the notices were the \"outcome of a political tussle between the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi and the ruling party in NCT of Delhi\" in which the petitioners were made \"scapegoats\". The PWD officials said in their petition they did not violate any rule, statute or office order and the work undertaken with regard to the chief minister\\'s official bungalow was in full discharge and in due course of their official duties. \"The petitioner(s) followed the instructions of the minister of PWD, GNCTD (Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi) and have consistently performed his duties under his vigilant supervision. It will not be out of place to emphasise that the petitioner all along acted in good faith, with no default, lapse or negligence on his part,\" their petition said. The show cause notices to the officials, however, said the old structure was demolished without a survey report and no building plan was sanctioned for the new building constructed by the PWD. The notices asked the PWD officials to explain their version \"as all such acts have been done by them in gross violation of general financial rules, CPWD manual and CVC guidelines\".(With PTI inputs)',\n",
       " 'HYDERABAD: With the Centre hinting at delimitation of Lok Sabha seats in 2026, Telangana, in all likelihood, is expected to lose three to four seats if the exercise is taken up on the basis of population.According to a report of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an international affairs think-tank based in Washington, Lok Sabha seats in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh would come down to 34 going by the projected population of both Telugu states by 2026. Presently, there are 42 seats in both states (Andhra Pradesh 25 and Telangana 17).\"If the delimitation committee takes 2011 Census as the basis, both states will have 37 seats and if the 2026 Census is taken, the seats will reduce to 34. Roughly, both states are likely to lose 5-8 seats in the process,\" a constitutional expert elaborated.While BRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao is likely to take up the issue at the national level and highlight \\'gross injustice\\', Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has already raised his voice against the Centre\\'s move by describing it as a sword of Damocles hanging over south Indian states. He also asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to give an assurance that no harm would be done to the southern states in the name of delimitation.BRS working president KT Rama Rao had earlier voiced a similar concern on the issue. Sources said BRS is getting ready to fight on the issue along with other south Indian states.Telangana State Planning Board vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar said they would fight for the state\\'s rights. \"The Centre has frozen the Lok Sabha seats by taking the 1971 population of various states as basis. We hope the Centre would continue with the same population norms for fixing the Lok Sabha seats. A progressive state like Telangana should not be penalised by reducing its Lok Sabha seats based on its present population,\" he told TOI.Working president of BRS KTR had earlier said it was unfortunate that progressive states in southern part of the country would lose Lok Sabha seats because of delimitation while northern states will gain more seats. “Not only in controlling population, even in human development index, southern states, which account for 18% of the country’s population, have been contributing 35% of the GDP,” KTR said some time back. Interestingly, the number of assembly seats in Telangana will increase if delimitation happens. The BRS government has been demanding delimitation of assembly seats in the last few years to increase the constituencies from 119 to 153. Similarly, AP seats will go up to 225 from the existing 175 seats.',\n",
       " \"The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has submitted a proposed regulation relating to modernisation of the H-1B visa program to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. This is the first step in the regulatory process and the entire process including calling for public opinions will take several months prior to finalisation of the rule.The proposed rule is likely to amend several aspects of the H-1B program, including amending the definition of the employer-employee relationship, establishing site visit requirements and guidelines for agency officials, addressing the F-1 (student visa) cap-gap issue, and increasing anti-fraud safeguards in the H-1B cap e-registration system. The Biden administration's first bi-annual agenda rolled out in June 2021 had mentioned many of these aspects as agenda items.The proposed rule is slated for publication in the Federal Register in December 2023, post which there will be an open window of 30-60 days for inviting public comments. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the new rules will kick in, in time for the forthcoming H-1B cap filing season which will typically open in March 2024. Of the annual quota of 85,000 H-1B cap visas, Indians especially those in the technology sector, bag a large chunk of the visa allotment.According to Mitch Wexler, partner at Fragomen, a global immigration law firm, “The high number of E-registration for H-1B cap visas submitted this March, for the fiscal ended September 2024 had prompted USCIS to suspect misuse, investigations were carried out and referrals were made to law enforcement authorities. The proposed H-1B rule is expected to introduce measures designed to reduce the potential for misuse so that this incident is not repeated.”As reported by TOI in its edition of April 30, USCIS stated that it received 7,58,994 eligible registrations, a rise of 60% over last year’s eligible registration pool. This led it to suspect gaming of the E-registration mechanism. Gaming happens when a set of sponsoring employers acting in conduit, make multiple registrations for the same individual to increase his/her chances of selection in the lottery, without each such registration having a bonafide job offer.If the proposed rules address the cap-gap issue, it will help the international student community in the US. The term cap-gap refers to the period between the time an international student’s F-1 status ends and the H-1B status begins. International students are eligible for a 12-month (three years for STEM students) optional practical training (OPT) under which they can work in the US. In many cases, the organizations where they are undergoing OPT sponsor them for the H-1B work visa. If the H-1B application is filed in time, they can continue working beyond the expiry date on their OPT employment authorization document, while waiting for the start date (October 1) of an approved or pending H-1B application. However, if the application is not processed by October 1, the student must stop working as of this date. Many students have lost out, because of this late processing and the proposed rule is likely to provide a solution.\",\n",

       " \"HYDERABAD: With various studies pointing to a strong correlation between Alzheimer’s disease and gut health, neurologists back home are recommending diet changes to their patients to keep the disease at bay. Just like poor gut health affects functions of the heart, kidney and liver, it also has an impact on the brain, say doctors. Hence, neurologists treating patients for Alzheimer's are increasingly recommending going back to the grandma's diet — basic food that the body doesn’t perceive as foreign.Reason: Doctors explain that with newer foods that one might not have had as a child, the body ends up creating an inflammatory reaction lowering cognitive health along with general health. “One reason for rapid increase in cases of Alzeihmer’s is the increase in consumption of non-native and brain-unfriendly food like fried items, alcohol and food with high carbohydrate content. Whatever we did not eat traditionally is perceived by the body as a foreign to which it reacts by creating inflammation. If the inflammatory markers remaine high for a substantial time, it leads to the onset of cognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s, dementia and even Parkinson’s. This happens because the brain too fights the inflammation and gets overworked in the process, resulting in decreased capacity,” said Dr Dushyanth Jasti, consultant neurologist adding that he has been getting at least 30 to 35 cases at his centre every month.Alzeihmer’s is a neurological disorder most commonly manifesting as a visuospatial disorientation — meaning the patient is unable to navigate common geographies like the house, usual road and often have disturbances in understanding these places. Forgetfulness is also a common sign. “Patients may find it difficult to locate the toilet or kitchen in their own homes or may not be able to locate a kirana store or friend’s home that they frequented earlier. They may have difficulty in identifying objects or understanding their functions despite having normal vision,” said Dr Sudhir Kumar, senior consultant neurologist.The fact that inflammatory conditions like diabetes, hypertension and obesity is on the rise has also contributed to the jump in numbers. “Since nutrition and level of physical activity has a correlation between brain function, we recommend a healthy balanced diet to our patients. The Alzheimer’s Association and World Dementia Council has found strong evidence to conclude that a healthy diet and lifelong learning can reduce the risk of decline in brain function,” said Dr M Jayasree, a consultant neurologist.\",\n",

       " \"Soumitra Chatterjee, an actor whose brilliance transcended international borders, was not confined to the realm of Bengali cinema alone. His legacy, though often associated with Satyajit Ray's cinematic genius, extended far beyond, encompassing the rich tapestry of world cinema. Regrettably, a significant portion of the Indian audience remains unaware of his luminous presence, largely due to his steadfast refusal to enter the Bollywood arena. Chatterjee's cinematic journey could have taken a different turn if he had accepted the offers from quite a few prominent Hindi films, all of which achieved significant acclaim. One of these notable opportunities came from the celebrated filmmaker Hrishikesh Mukherjee. In 1971, Mukherjee approached Chatterjee for the role of Dr. Bhaskar Banerjee in the iconic film 'Anand.' However, Chatterjee had to decline this role due to scheduling conflicts with his commitments to Bengali cinema. Yet, he expressed no regrets about his decision. As fate would have it, the role of Dr. Bhaskar Banerjee in 'Anand' was eventually portrayed by Amitabh Bachchan, marking a pivotal moment in Bachchan's career as it catapulted him to stardom. Hrishikesh Mukherjee's 'Anand' itself remains a cherished cinematic gem, telling the poignant tale of a terminally ill man who spreads joy wherever he goes, drawing inspiration from the director's own life experiences. Despite receiving multiple offers from Bollywood, Soumitra Chatterjee chose to remain dedicated to Bengali cinema and his literary pursuits. He believed that venturing into Bollywood might restrict his freedom to explore other creative endeavors. Chatterjee's unwavering commitment to his craft and his refusal to compromise his artistic integrity is a lesson for any aspiring actor. In 2020, the legendary actor bid farewell to the mortal world, leaving behind a legacy that continues to shine brightly in Bengal. Soumitra Chatterjee's contributions to the art of acting, his enduring influence, and his steadfast commitment to his craft will forever be remembered, both within and beyond the borders of Bengal. His legacy serves as a testament to the power of cinema to transcend geographical boundaries and leave an indelible imprint on the hearts and minds of audiences.\",\n",

       " 'HYDERABAD: With the Centre hinting at delimitation of Lok Sabha seats in 2026, Telangana, in all likelihood, is expected to lose three to four seats if the exercise is taken up on the basis of population.According to a report of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an international affairs think-tank based in Washington, Lok Sabha seats in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh would come down to 34 going by the projected population of both Telugu states by 2026. Presently, there are 42 seats in both states (Andhra Pradesh 25 and Telangana 17).\"If the delimitation committee takes 2011 Census as the basis, both states will have 37 seats and if the 2026 Census is taken, the seats will reduce to 34. Roughly, both states are likely to lose 5-8 seats in the process,\" a constitutional expert elaborated.While BRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao is likely to take up the issue at the national level and highlight \\'gross injustice\\', Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has already raised his voice against the Centre\\'s move by describing it as a sword of Damocles hanging over south Indian states. He also asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to give an assurance that no harm would be done to the southern states in the name of delimitation.BRS working president KT Rama Rao had earlier voiced a similar concern on the issue. Sources said BRS is getting ready to fight on the issue along with other south Indian states.Telangana State Planning Board vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar said they would fight for the state\\'s rights. \"The Centre has frozen the Lok Sabha seats by taking the 1971 population of various states as basis. We hope the Centre would continue with the same population norms for fixing the Lok Sabha seats. A progressive state like Telangana should not be penalised by reducing its Lok Sabha seats based on its present population,\" he told TOI.Working president of BRS KTR had earlier said it was unfortunate that progressive states in southern part of the country would lose Lok Sabha seats because of delimitation while northern states will gain more seats. “Not only in controlling population, even in human development index, southern states, which account for 18% of the country’s population, have been contributing 35% of the GDP,” KTR said some time back. Interestingly, the number of assembly seats in Telangana will increase if delimitation happens.

       " 'MUMBAI: According to a D P Advisory \\'Beyond 22 Yards – IPL’s Evolution meets WPL’s Aspiration, an IPL WPL Valuation report\\' launched on Thursday, the ecosystem value of the IPL is now $11.2 billion, up by 3.3% from $10.9 billion in 2022.Drawing from the analysis into the revenue dynamics and value distribution, approximately 60-65% of this valuation accrues to the BCCI, with the remaining 35-40% accruing to all IPL teams. This translates to an aggregate business value of around $3.9-4.5 billion for all franchises combined. Given the league\\'s current composition of 10 franchises, this suggests an average intrinsic business valuation per team falling in the ballpark of $390-450 million.The WPL stands on the cusp of revolutionizing women\\'s cricket in India, much like the transformative role the IPL played for men\\'s cricket. The WPL boasted a remarkable valuation of Rs 1,250 crore equating to approximately $150 million. While it might be intuitive for some to equate the WPL directly with the IPL, the importance of recognizing their distinct structural nuances directly impacts their ecosystem valuations. The IPL’s inaugural season commenced with a larger framework, featuring 8 teams and a total of 59 matches. In contrast, the WPL started on a more modest scale, with 5 teams playing 22 matches. Given that the league\\'s value is intrinsically linked to the number of matches, this disparity in scale is a significant factor in the valuation differences between the two leagues. This distinction underscores the established market presence and demand that IPL has enjoyed from its inception.D P Advisory is a provider of consulting, advisory, and valuation services. Their consolidated report is a pioneering effort reflecting India’s dynamic cricketing landscape. The debut of the Women’s Premier League (WPL).In a release, Santosh N, Managing Partner of D P Advisory said, \"With the successful inaugural season and substantial investments, the WPL is making strides towards achieving gender pay parity and providing a level playing field for women in cricket. The league promotes the values of inclusivity and diversity in the cricketing ecosystem. The team’s branding efforts, fan engagement strategies, and ESA initiatives have all contributed to its enduring success and popularity. Moreover, the WPL serves as a platform for infrastructure development and grassroots-level talent, bridging the gap between domestic and international cricket and is slated to reach greater heights in the next two or three years.” Anurag Dahiya, Chief Commercial Officer at ICC, commented, \"There can be no doubt that with WPL, women’s cricket stands at the cusp of a transformative journey in India. With continued strategic investments, infrastructural enhancements, and genuine intent, it is poised to do for women\\'s cricket what IPL did for the men\\'s game. It is not just about mainstreaming; it is about setting the gold standard and asserting that women\\'s cricket isn\\'t an also-ran – it is a star-studded show in its own right.\"The report focuses on rankings over specific values to overcome intrinsic volatility and uncertainty surrounding certain revenue streams, notably merchandising. A significant factor to note here is that the central pool constitutes a substantial portion—about 70-75% of any individual franchise\\'s overall revenue, ensuring a closely aligned intrinsic value for all franchises. This value is fundamentally rooted in three key parameters: (i) the projected cash flows the asset is expected to generate, (ii) the growth trajectory of these cash flows, and (iii) the associated risks that might affect the asset\\'s ability to realize these projections. As per these parameters of the report, Mumbai Indians emerges as the most valued IPL franchise in 2023 with its intrinsic business value within the range of $410-450 Million and leads the brand valuation table in 2023.\"The future of cricket in India looks promising. With leagues like WPL and IPL, the sport is not only reaching new heights in terms of viewership and fan engagement but also contributing significantly to the business ecosystem. As the lines between sports and entertainment continue to blur, the value that these leagues bring, both in monetary terms and societal impact, is undeniable,\" says the report.',\n",

About 48 hours later, the 29-year-old finds himself a part of the Netherlands support-staff as a net bowler, trying to help the minnows prepare against spin in their pre World Cup camp in Alur. Lokesh, who has been working in the food delivery industry since 2018, was on Tuesday hand-picked as one of the four net bowlers by the Dutch side that had advertised for the role on social media. A leftarm pacer-turned-chinaman, Lokesh was selected after the Netherlands management assessed about 10,000 bowlers from India, who had sent their entries by uploading videos on a mobile application. “This is one of the most precious moments of my career. I am yet to even play in the TNCA third division league. I played in the fifth division for four years and I have registered for fourth-division outfit Indian Oil (RO) SRC for the ongoing season. After being picked by the Netherlands as a net bowler, I feel that my talent has finally been recognised,” Lokesh, who joined the Dutch camp on Wednesday, told TOI. “The Netherlands team members welcomed me with open arms; there was an induction ceremony for the net bowlers before the beginning of the session. The players told us: ‘feel free, this is your team’. I already feel that I am part of the Dutch family,” Lokesh added. Lokesh said he was confident that he would make the cut for the camp. “After seeing the advertisement, I was keen to give it a try. I felt that I would have an edge over others as there are not many chinaman bowlers in the country. Netherlands were looking for a mystery spinner. So, I decided to give it a try.” Lokesh said that working as a food delivery executive has been indirectly helping him grow as a cricketer. “After my college days, my entire focus was on cricket. I spent four years on cricket. In 2018, I decided to take up a job. I have been with Swiggy for the last four years. I earn money only by delivering food; I do not have any other source of income. The work timings are flexible and I can take leave whenever I want to. We usually have TNCA league matches only on the weekends, so I work during the weekdays,” said Lokesh.',\n",

       " \"Soumitra Chatterjee, an actor whose brilliance transcended international borders, was not confined to the realm of Bengali cinema alone. His legacy, though often associated with Satyajit Ray's cinematic genius, extended far beyond, encompassing the rich tapestry of world cinema. Regrettably, a significant portion of the Indian audience remains unaware of his luminous presence, largely due to his steadfast refusal to enter the Bollywood arena. Chatterjee's cinematic journey could have taken a different turn if he had accepted the offers from quite a few prominent Hindi films, all of which achieved significant acclaim. One of these notable opportunities came from the celebrated filmmaker Hrishikesh Mukherjee. In 1971, Mukherjee approached Chatterjee for the role of Dr. Bhaskar Banerjee in the iconic film 'Anand.' However, Chatterjee had to decline this role due to scheduling conflicts with his commitments to Bengali cinema. Yet, he expressed no regrets about his decision. As fate would have it, the role of Dr. Bhaskar Banerjee in 'Anand' was eventually portrayed by Amitabh Bachchan, marking a pivotal moment in Bachchan's career as it catapulted him to stardom. Hrishikesh Mukherjee's 'Anand' itself remains a cherished cinematic gem, telling the poignant tale of a terminally ill man who spreads joy wherever he goes, drawing inspiration from the director's own life experiences. Despite receiving multiple offers from Bollywood, Soumitra Chatterjee chose to remain dedicated to Bengali cinema and his literary pursuits. He believed that venturing into Bollywood might restrict his freedom to explore other creative endeavors. Chatterjee's unwavering commitment to his craft and his refusal to compromise his artistic integrity is a lesson for any aspiring actor. In 2020, the legendary actor bid farewell to the mortal world, leaving behind a legacy that continues to shine brightly in Bengal. Soumitra Chatterjee's contributions to the art of acting, his enduring influence, and his steadfast commitment to his craft will forever be remembered, both within and beyond the borders of Bengal. His legacy serves as a testament to the power of cinema to transcend geographical boundaries and leave an indelible imprint on the hearts and minds of audiences.\",\n",

Earlier, it had planned to open both the stretches - Byappanahalli to KR Pura and Kengeri to Challaghatta - together, facilitating operations on the entire corridor of the line from Challaghatta to Kadugodi (Whitefield) for a length of 43km.Now, BMRCL is contemplating opening the KR Pura-Byappanahalli stretch first. As per the revised schedule, the commissioner of Metro railway safety (CMRS) is slated to hold a safety inspection on this stretch on September 21. For the other line, the schedule is yet to be fixed. A likely delay in getting safety clearance for Kengeri-Challaghatta line is forcing BMRCL to revisit its earlier decision. \"We are contemplating opening KR PuraByappanahalli line as and when we get safety clearance from the statutory authority. The reason is there is a lot of demand to link the Whitefield line that has been operational since March,\" an official said.The official said only after September 25, they will get more clarity on when the safety inspection for Kengeri-Challaghatta line will be scheduled.

Are we going to inaugurate before September or early October?

He told News 18 in an interview that he has a huge shadow of his father and he has make his way through. According to him, everyone expects him to do an action film just because his father is known for his action films so he is just curious to see how the audience will react to his debut film.Talking about being compared to his superstar father, Rajveer added that the audience has seen his father succeeding as an action hero and he does it so well. He believes that fans want a new version of his father for the next generation. However, for him to be the next action hero is asking for too much and it’s not natural for him. According to him, this is a different time and they both have their own identities. The actor added that the best thing to do is to ignore these comparisons and do what he wants to do and what he thinks is good for him.Rajveer also went on to admit that he is happy about not being launched by his own family. He said that after 'Pal Pal Dil Ke Pass' was released, he saw his brother Karan Deol going through his all-time low.

       " \"NEW DELHI: Team India prepares to face Australia in a crucial three-game series that doubles as the final dress rehearsal before the impending ICC ODI World Cup. With stalwarts Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Kuldeep Yadav, and Hardik Pandya taking a break for the initial matches, it's a pivotal moment for head coach Rahul Dravid to assess India's bench strength.Amidst this high-stakes encounter, two Mumbai-based batsmen, Shreyas Iyer and Suryakumar Yadav, are locked in personal battles to secure their places in the all-important World Cup squad.Iyer's fitnessShreyas Iyer, at the age of 28, stands at a crossroads in his career. Limited cricketing action in the last six months due to a stress fracture surgery has raised concerns about his match fitness. A recent episode of a stiff back just before an Asia Cup match against Pakistan added to the worries. While chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar has given the green light for Iyer to participate in the three-game series, the true test lies in whether his body can withstand the demands of playing 100 overs over the next five days.Iyer's reputation as a formidable batter of spin bowling in the middle overs could be an invaluable asset for India in the upcoming World Cup.Suryakumar's ODI aspirationsMeanwhile, Suryakumar Yadav, popularly known as 'SKY,' has soared in T20Is, but he faces the challenge of carving a niche for himself in the realm of ODI cricket. Despite having 27 ODIs under his belt, his average of less than 25 begs the question of his suitability in the 50-over format. While he may not be a regular starter in the World Cup XI, he's determined to convince the team management of his worth.The emergence of young talent Tilak Varma puts pressure on Suryakumar's position, and at the age of 33, this may be his final opportunity to feature in a 50-over World Cup.'Ash' gets a chanceAn unexpected door has opened for the seasoned 37-year-old Ravichandran Ashwin due to a small quadriceps tear suffered by left-arm spinner Axar Patel. If Axar doesn't recover in time, Ashwin could make his third and potentially final appearance in a 50-over World Cup.Remarkably, just two weeks ago, Ashwin wasn't even in contention, but now he finds himself in competition with his younger state-mate Washington Sundar for a spot in the squad. Recent buzz suggests that Ashwin, even if he doesn't perform exceptionally well in the upcoming matches, stands a better chance of inclusion compared to Washington. The prospect of Ashwin locking horns with David Warner and Steve Smith promises to be a treat for cricket enthusiasts.The absence of Kuldeep Yadav and Hardik Pandya presents both Ashwin and Washington with an opportunity to showcase their skills to the team.However, it's important to note that even if Ashwin excels, the team management may opt for Axar if he regains fitness in time for the third ODI. Typically, a small tear takes around two weeks to heal, and for a spinner, it is a less severe injury compared to fast bowlers, who require more time to recover. India remains optimistic about Axar's fitness ahead of the World Cup.Team composition and bowler workloadWith Rohit Sharma absent from the top order, Ishan Kishan is likely to open alongside Shubman Gill, while Shreyas Iyer fills in for Virat Kohli, who needs valuable game time. The workload management of fast bowlers, particularly Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, will be a key consideration given the tight schedule, including three 50-over games in five days and travel commitments.Australia, the team to beat in WCAustralia, despite a recent 2-3 series loss to South Africa, remain a formidable team. Their victory in the last ODI series in India in March and their track record of success in subcontinental conditions make them strong contenders for the World Cup. Worth noting is that India and Australia will clash again on October 8 during the marquee event.Australia's bowling attack faces a stern test on subcontinent pitches known for favouring batsmen.SquadIndia: KL Rahul (C WK), Ravindra Jadeja (Vice-captain), Ruturaj Gaikwad, Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Ishan Kishan (wicketkeeper), Shardul Thakur, Washington Sundar, R Ashwin, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd.

       " 'Canada said it would reduce the number of diplomats in India due to security concerns, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government appeared to suspend visas for Canadians as a diplomatic row escalated over the murder of a Sikh activist. Global Affairs Canada said some diplomats have received threats on social media platforms, part of an unfolding backlash in the South Asian country following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s claims on Monday that Indian government agents assassinated a prominent Sikh leader on Canadian soil. New Delhi has called the allegations “absurd” and denied involvement in the June 19 shooting of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was pushing for an independent Sikh homeland in India. “In the light of the current environment where tensions have heightened, we are taking action to ensure the safety of our diplomats,” Global Affairs Canada said in a statement Thursday. “Out of an abundance of caution, we have decided to temporarily adjust staff presence in India.”',\n",
       " \"The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has submitted a proposed regulation relating to modernisation of the H-1B visa program to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. This is the first step in the regulatory process and the entire process including calling for public opinions will take several months prior to finalisation of the rule.The proposed rule is likely to amend several aspects of the H-1B program, including amending the definition of the employer-employee relationship, establishing site visit requirements and guidelines for agency officials, addressing the F-1 (student visa) cap-gap issue, and increasing anti-fraud safeguards in the H-1B cap e-registration system. The Biden administration's first bi-annual agenda rolled out in June 2021 had mentioned many of these aspects as agenda items.The proposed rule is slated for publication in the Federal Register in December 2023, post which there will be an open window of 30-60 days for inviting public comments. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the new rules will kick in, in time for the forthcoming H-1B cap filing season which will typically open in March 2024. Of the annual quota of 85,000 H-1B cap visas, Indians especially those in the technology sector, bag a large chunk of the visa allotment.According to Mitch Wexler, partner at Fragomen, a global immigration law firm, “The high number of E-registration for H-1B cap visas submitted this March, for the fiscal ended September 2024 had prompted USCIS to suspect misuse, investigations were carried out and referrals were made to law enforcement authorities. The proposed H-1B rule is expected to introduce measures designed to reduce the potential for misuse so that this incident is not repeated.”As reported by TOI in its edition of April 30, USCIS stated that it received 7,58,994 eligible registrations, a rise of 60% over last year’s eligible registration pool. This led it to suspect gaming of the E-registration mechanism. Gaming happens when a set of sponsoring employers acting in conduit, make multiple registrations for the same individual to increase his/her chances of selection in the lottery, without each such registration having a bonafide job offer.If the proposed rules address the cap-gap issue, it will help the international student community in the US. The term cap-gap refers to the period between the time an international student’s F-1 status ends and the H-1B status begins. International students are eligible for a 12-month (three years for STEM students) optional practical training (OPT) under which they can work in the US. In many cases, the organizations where they are undergoing OPT sponsor them for the H-1B work visa. If the H-1B application is filed in time, they can continue working beyond the expiry date on their OPT employment authorization document, while waiting for the start date (October 1) of an approved or pending H-1B application. However, if the application is not processed by October 1, the student must stop working as of this date. Many students have lost out, because of this late processing and the proposed rule is likely to provide a solution.\",\n",

After the incident which happened at a school in Khubbapur area of Muzaffarnagar last month, the teacher had been charged under sections 504 (intentionally insulting someone to provoke them) and 323 (related to voluntarily causing hurt) of the IPC. Legal experts said that both these sections do not entail stringent punishment, unlike Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act (pertains to person having control of child, assaults, abandons, abuses or willfully neglects the child). \"An individual charged under Section 75 of the JJ Act could face imprisonment for a maximum of three years,\" special public prosecutor, Dinesh Sharma, said.Deputy superintendent of police, Khatauli, Ravi Shankar Mishra, said that \"it was decided to add the section of the Juvenile Justice Act after detailed investigation was conducted in the matter.\" The video of the incident showed Tyagi apparently instigating other students to physically assault the boy.',\n",

       " \"Vishal Bharadwaj became part of movies first as a music director and with passing time he tapped into his inner talents and turned into a director and delivered movies like Makdee, Maqbool, Kaminey, Haider etc. The director is now going to make his debut as a director on OTT with Charlie Chopra and The Mystery of Solang Valley which is based on Agatha Christie’s The Sittaford Mystery. Excerpts from interview:You have usually worked on plays written by Shakespeare but for your OTT debut with Charlie Chopra and The Mystery of Solang Valley, you chose to adapt Agatha Christie’s book. So did you get into a fight with Shakespeare this time around?(Laughs) No, it has been about 10 years since I made Haider, last of my tragedy trilogy of Shakespeare’s work. But yes I want to start work on his comedy trilogy soon. Coming to Charlie Chopra, I have been wanting to do a whodunit by Agatha Christie for a very long time. Actually I had taken the rights of the book back in 2019.Earlier I had written a movie script based on the book but the cast that I wanted to make it with and the way I wanted to make it, it was getting difficult to raise money for it . This project would have shut down had I not met up with the creative head of Sony Liv Danish Khan. He mentioned that we haven't worked together and if I would have anything which we can work together on. So I told him I have a film script, but he told me they don't work on films and asked me if I can convert it into a series .The best part of working on a series for a filmmaker is that he doesn't have to let go of his detailing.You and Irrfan Khan had a very close bond. Post his demise, you wrote a screenplay called Irrfan and I, which was printed in Times Of India. Have you ever revisited it after that ?I was very emotionally disturbed when he passed away. I get disturbed even now when I think about Irrfan. Back then I wanted to say something. A lot of people asked me to write for their publication, someone even asked to write a chapter on him, a book was being written on him. I wanted to speak in the language with which Irrfan and I connected, so I attempted the screenplay which showcased our journey . I then showed it to Gulzar saab and he was moved, he asked me to write more about it. It is like a biographical relationship between an actor and director and it was cinematic as cinema was my and Irrfan’s language. Writing it was my catharsis. Meghna Gulzar told me to make it into a film or something and I told her I can't do it as I'm a character in it . She suggested she wants to make it or if Aasman, my son, could make it. But sooner or later it should be made. Your son Aasman, made his debut as a director with Kuttey. The film didn’t do well at the box office. How do you look back at his journey?As a father I’m very proud of him that he chose to make such a difficult film as his first film. I think he shouldn’t have done that. Even I attempted Kaminey after I had a couple of films under my belt. It is a difficult genre where a lot is happening in just one night. I never went on the sets because I didn't want anyone to feel that I made it. I was happy that he alone was able to pull it off, people may not have liked the film but I feel he knows his craft.One of your strongest connections in the industry has been Gulzar, how do see your equation with him?I have been very fortunate, I don't know what more I can ask from life. We have been working together for the last 34 years, there was a point when I was hoping to get just one song with him and today we have done over 50 films and 600 songs together.One striking aspect of all your films has been that they are anti-establishment, do you feel it is getting riskier with every passing day ?Yes. I don't think you should even ask this question. Yes, these are difficult times for freedom of speech, but I think we will move out of this phase as well.

This translates to an aggregate business value of around $3.9-4.5 billion for all franchises combined. Given the league\\'s current composition of 10 franchises, this suggests an average intrinsic business valuation per team falling in the ballpark of $390-450 million.The WPL stands on the cusp of revolutionizing women\\'s cricket in India, much like the transformative role the IPL played for men\\'s cricket. The WPL boasted a remarkable valuation of Rs 1,250 crore equating to approximately $150 million. While it might be intuitive for some to equate the WPL directly with the IPL, the importance of recognizing their distinct structural nuances directly impacts their ecosystem valuations. The IPL’s inaugural season commenced with a larger framework, featuring 8 teams and a total of 59 matches. In contrast, the WPL started on a more modest scale, with 5 teams playing 22 matches. Given that the league\\'s value is intrinsically linked to the number of matches, this disparity in scale is a significant factor in the valuation differences between the two leagues. This distinction underscores the established market presence and demand that IPL has enjoyed from its inception.D P Advisory is a provider of consulting, advisory, and valuation services. Their consolidated report is a pioneering effort reflecting India’s dynamic cricketing landscape. The debut of the Women’s Premier League (WPL).In a release, Santosh N, Managing Partner of D P Advisory said, \"With the successful inaugural season and substantial investments, the WPL is making strides towards achieving gender pay parity and providing a level playing field for women in cricket. The league promotes the values of inclusivity and diversity in the cricketing ecosystem. The team’s branding efforts, fan engagement strategies, and ESA initiatives have all contributed to its enduring success and popularity. Moreover, the WPL serves as a platform for infrastructure development and grassroots-level talent, bridging the gap between domestic and international cricket and is slated to reach greater heights in the next two or three years.” Anurag Dahiya, Chief Commercial Officer at ICC, commented, \"There can be no doubt that with WPL, women’s cricket stands at the cusp of a transformative journey in India. With continued strategic investments, infrastructural enhancements, and genuine intent, it is poised to do for women\\'s cricket what IPL did for the men\\'s game. It is not just about mainstreaming; it is about setting the gold standard and asserting that women\\'s cricket isn\\'t an also-ran – it is a star-studded show in its own right.\"The report focuses on rankings over specific values to overcome intrinsic volatility and uncertainty surrounding certain revenue streams, notably merchandising. A significant factor to note here is that the central pool constitutes a substantial portion—about 70-75% of any individual franchise\\'s overall revenue, ensuring a closely aligned intrinsic value for all franchises. This value is fundamentally rooted in three key parameters: (i) the projected cash flows the asset is expected to generate, (ii) the growth trajectory of these cash flows, and (iii) the associated risks that might affect the asset\\'s ability to realize these projections. As per these parameters of the report, Mumbai Indians emerges as the most valued IPL franchise in 2023 with its intrinsic business value within the range of $410-450 Million and leads the brand valuation table in 2023.\"The future of cricket in India looks promising. With leagues like WPL and IPL, the sport is not only reaching new heights in terms of viewership and fan engagement but also contributing significantly to the business ecosystem. As the lines between sports and entertainment continue to blur, the value that these leagues bring, both in monetary terms and societal impact, is undeniable,\" says the report.',\n",
       " \"NEW DELHI: Shafali Verma showcased her batting prowess, smashing an electrifying 67 off just 39 deliveries as India stormed into the semifinals of the women's cricket event at the Asian Games. This advancement came about as a result of India's superior ICC rankings after Thursday's quarter-final clash was prematurely abandoned due to adverse weather conditions.With the match being reduced to a 15-over-a-side contest, India exhibited remarkable batting prowess, posting an imposing total of 173 for the loss of 2 wickets. This impressive total was primarily attributed to the stellar performances of Shafali Verma, skipper Smriti Mandhana, who contributed 27 runs from 16 balls, and Jemimah Rodrigues, who blazed her way to 47 runs from 29 deliveries. Richa Ghosh's cameo, contributing 21 runs from a mere 7 balls, served as the icing on the cake.For Malaysia, the monumental task of surpassing the 100-run mark, let alone chasing the revised target of 177 set by the DLS method, was all but impossible. Malaysia only managed to face two deliveries before torrential rain intervened, forcing the match to be called off prematurely.India's superior ICC ranking, as of June 1, placed them as the top-seeded Asian team in the competition, thereby securing their passage to the semifinals.Opting to field first on a sluggish pitch, Malaysia's skipper Winifred Duraisingam watched as her team struggled, marred by sloppy fielding that resulted in several dropped catches. Malaysia's bowling attack lacked the firepower to trouble India's batters. The lack of pace in their deliveries forced Shafali Verma to frequently step down the track in a bid to meet the ball early. Meanwhile, Smriti Mandhana capitalized on full-toss deliveries, dispatching them to all corners of the ground.India's opening pair accumulated 59 runs within the Powerplay before Smriti Mandhana was dismissed while attempting a pull shot off a slightly fuller delivery from spinner Mahira Izzati Ismail.Shafali Verma's fierce innings featured five towering sixes and four boundaries. Her striking prowess was prominently evident in the region between square leg and deep mid-wicket, along with a straight six that propelled her to a well-deserved half-century.Jemimah Rodrigues showcased her fine form, amassing six boundaries and forming a crucial partnership of 86 runs for the second wicket with Shafali. However, Shafali Verma faced a moment of discomfort when she was struck on her right forearm by a powerful back-drive by Rodrigues, necessitating immediate medical attention.Despite a reprieve in the deep off the bowling of Mas Elysa, Shafali Verma was subsequently caught plumb in front. Richa Ghosh's explosive performance in the final over of the innings, including four boundaries, propelled India past the 170-run mark.India's remarkable batting display and Shafali Verma's explosive innings secured their place in the semifinals, leading them to victory over Malaysia due to their superior ICC ranking.(With PTI inputs)\",\n",

       " 'GURGAON: The state government is planning to construct a 9km long road to improve connectivity between AIIMS’ National Cancer Institute in Jhajjar’s Bhadsa with Dwarka Expressway. The road is expected to be six lanes wide, for which the public works department (PWD) is planning to acquire around 102.3 acres of land in six villages in Gurgaon and Jhajjar. The road will lead to the expressway through Sector 102. According to PWD officials, around 76% of the farmers have given consent for the acquisition after compensation. The government is planning to come up with a fixed rate per acre for land acquisition after detailed discussion and consultation with the farmers.The road will also provide connectivity with Delhi and IGI airport via the Dwarka Expressway. Land will be acquired in Kherki Majra (17.5 acres), Dhankot (13.4 acres), Budhera (24 acres), Makrola (35.6 acres), Iqbalpur (6.6 acres) and Bhadsa (5 acres). The project is expected to cost around Rs 272.1 crore, of which Rs 206.8 crore will be required for land acquisition and Rs 65.3 crore for road construction.“Land parcels around 45m wide will be acquired from Bhadsa to Makdola, while from Makdola to Kherki Majra, around 60m-wide plots will be acquired for the proposed road. The road will connect AIIMS Jhajjar to Dwarka Expressway at Sector 102. There is a plan to construct a flyover at this point to connect both roads,” a senior PWD official said.At present, people from the city heading towards AIIMS Jhajjar have to take Badli Road from Basai. This road is narrow and remains congested due to heavy traffic movement.AIIMS Jhajjar has around 500 patients visiting its OPDs every day, who have to wait for 20 to 25 days to get an appointment. The hospital has 250 beds at present, which is expected to be increased to 700 by next year.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had in December 2015 announced that a four-lane road would be built to connect Jhajjar’s Badli with IGI airport. The state government gave administrative approval for the construction of the road in May 2017. The proposed AIIMS-Dwarka Expressway link is part of the CM’s announcement.The road is likely to start at AIIMS in Bhadsa and end at Sector 102 via Iqbalpur, Makrola, Budhera, Dhankot and Kherki Majra. For the project, the state government is planning to acquire around 98.6 acres of private land and 3.7 acres of panchayat land. It has received consent from farmers for acquisition of 78.2 acres till now, which is around 76.4% of the total land required. “The process of availing consent from the remaining landowners is under progress,” an official said.',\n",
       " \"Construction of the 1,382 km Delhi-Mumbai Expressway has been going on under full-swing, once completed, the project is designed to cut travel time down to just 12 hours between the two major cities. In February 2023, the first phase of the expressway between Delhi and Rajasthan’s Jaipur was opened to the public. The new stretch of expressway, led to a reduction of 2 hours travel time between Delhi and Jaipur. Once completed, the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway will cut across six states, including Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Here are some latest updates on the current progress of the massive project. Latest development:The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) recently issued a public notice, listing the fee structures for vehicles plying on seven stretches across Madhya Pradesh (MP). The Madhya Pradesh part of the Expressway is being completed in nine stages and will stretch between the 220 kilometre 220 to kilometre marker to 720 km marker on the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, once it is completed. 244 km stretch inaugurated in MP between Jhabua to Jhalawar:NHAI has formally inaugurated the 244 km stretch between Madhya Pradesh's Jhabua to Rajashtan's Modak, near Jhalawar, on September 20. The new stretch of expressway passes through Jhabua, Mandsaur and Ratlam districts in Madhya Pradesh and will connect major cities, including Garoth, Jaora, Ratlam, and Thandla in the state.Is the Expressway between Jhabua (MP) to Delhi complete? Not reallyAccording to HV Kumar, Indian highway and automotive expert, the drive from Jhabua to Delhi cannot be made completely on the Expressway yet. Between the journey from Jhabua to Delhi, travellers will need to exit the expressway at Modak and follow the Ujjain - Kota - Tonk - Lalsot (old route). Vehicles again have the option of re-entering the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway from the Lalsot on ramp to reach Delhi (Sohna Road). Expert, HV Kumar further reported that the patch between leaving the expressway at Modak and catching it again at Lalsot, is not an easy drive. While the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway between Delhi to Lalsot in Rajasthan (South of Jaipur) has been operational since February, HV Kumar reports that the section between Rajasthan's Lalsot and Sawai has also been completed now, however, it is not open to the public yet. We can expect the stretch to open soon and offer a higher stretch of uninterrupted travel on the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway. When will the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway get completed?The foundation stone for the massive road network project was laid in March 2019 and the deadline for completion is by December 2024.\",\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: After arranging for a sustenance budget of Rs one crore that keeps him going on the ATP Tour, India\\'s number one tennis player Sumit Nagal is left with less than Rs one lakh in his bank account and a morose feeling of not leading a good life. He has been training at the Nansel Tennis Academy in Germany for a few years but lack of funds meant that he could not train at his favourite place in the first three months of season 2023. His friends Somdev Devvarman and Christopher Marcuis helped him stay in shape in January and February before he finally managed to fund his stay in Germany. The fund crunch is the story of probably every Indian tennis player but the fact that the country\\'s number one singles player is not saving enough money for himself and his family just exposes the unhelpful system and the brutal Tour where the players wage lonely battles. To stay and play on the extravagant ATP Tour, Nagal has invested all his prize money, his salary from IOCL and the support he gets from Maha Tennis Foundation. The expenditure is related to his stay at the training centre in Peine and his travel for tournaments along with either his coach or a physio. \"If I look at my bank balance, I have what I had at the beginning of the year. It is 900 euros (approx Rs 80,000). I did get a bit of help. Mr Prashant Sutar is helping me with MAHA Tennis Foundation and I also get monthly (salary) from IOCL but I don\\'t have any big sponsor,\" Nagal told PTI in an interview. Nagal\\'s racquet, shoes and apparel needs are being taken care of by Yonex and ASICS respectively. This year in 24 tournaments played, Nagal has earned about 65 lakh with his biggest pay cheque coming from the US Open where he lost the first round of the Qualifiers and still pocketed USD 22,000 (approx Rs 18 lakh). \"I am investing whatever I am making. The yearly cost where I travel with one coach is costing me around 80 lakh to 1 crore and that is just with one travelling coach (no physio). Whatever I have made I have already invested. \"I feel like I am lacking support despite being India\\'s number one player for past few years. I am the only player to qualify for Grand Slams, only player to win a (tennis) match at the Olympics (Tokyo) in last few years, and still the government has not added my name to the TOPS. \"I felt when my ranking dropped after injury, no one wanted to help me, no one really believed that I could be back. That was disappointing because I feel whatever I do is not enough. It\\'s so hard to find financial support in India. To be honest I do not know what to do, I have given up.\" The son of a primary school teacher in Punjabi Bagh, Nagal fought off-court battles last year when he underwent a hip surgery and also contracted COVID a couple of times. It was not surprising that he began to doubt if he will ever get back to tennis courts. Sitting and waiting is never easy for an athlete. \"Rehab took six months, then coming back to play took another six months. I would say I took a year-and-a-half, just to feel okay. \"It was in mid-summer last year when I started feeling better. I lost a few matches I should have won, I lost matches from match-points or when serving for a match and when I was a set and a break up. I got COVID twice last year, so I had long, long two years. \"I don\\'t have anything in savings. I am just breaking even. I can not say I live a very good life or where I say I don\\'t need to work. I did not earn anything in the last two years so I am happy that I am breaking even. At least I am not in minus where I have to leave academy and travel on my own.\" Nagal said his coaches advised him to save money and then get back to Germany. \"I sat with Sasha Nansel (his coach) and Milos (his fitness trainer). They said you do a few things yourself and try to save as much money as possible in India and we start again in April again. \"I travel with one of the two, and this is just the basic. I am not saying I want to stay at a five star hotel, nothing like that, this is just the basic.\" A look at the ATP singles chart shows that Nagal is best-ranked Indian at 159. The next best is Sasikumar Mukund, way back at 407. Out of action Prajnesh Gunneswaran is further behind at number 540 and is followed by Digvijay Pratap Singh (554) and Ramkumar Ramanathan (569). Nagal rues that Indian singles players not just lack the financial support but also the guidance. \"We lack funding, we lack the system. If there is a system, there will be funding. China has money. We have potential like China. Why do we win just 5-6 medals in Olympics but China won 38 gold (in Tokyo). \"We are 1.4 billion, we can match them in talent but why we do not make it to high level? The guidance is missing. In tennis, we are far away from competing at top. \"I am improving. I do feel I have the game. If my body is good and I am playing tournaments, I feel I am ready (for big leap).\"',\n",

       " \"India's manufacturing success in the global arena over the past five years has been notable and it has emerged as a winner, as per a study by BCG, quoted in an ET report. During this period, Indian exports to the US surged by $23 billion, marking a 44% increase from 2018 to 2022. In contrast, China experienced a 10% drop in its exports to the US.The study, titled 'Harnessing the Tectonic Shifts in Global Manufacturing,' sheds light on the transformation in manufacturing and sourcing across various industries. This shift has been triggered by factors such as trade disputes, the pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain disruptions. In response, global companies have had to reconsider their manufacturing and sourcing strategies, with India emerging as a favored destination.The study highlights India's advantage in direct manufacturing costs as an export platform. According to BCG's calculations, the average cost of Indian-made goods imported into the US, factoring in factory wages, productivity, logistics, tariffs, and energy, is 15% lower compared to goods manufactured in the US. In contrast, Chinese goods offer only a 4% cost advantage over US-made products and are 21% more expensive when subject to US tariffs related to the trade war. Specifically, semiconductor and material shipments from India to the US saw a remarkable 143% increase over the past five years, though starting from a modest base. Meanwhile, China's exports in these categories decreased by 29%. Furthermore, Indian exports of auto components to the US rose by 65%, and mechanical machinery exports grew by 70%.Ravi Srivastava, the global leader of BCG's operations practice said that for the past two decades, there has been talk of India's potential in manufacturing, often with a lingering question mark. Now, it seems that many pieces of the puzzle are falling into place. What sets this study apart is its comprehensive perspective, not only delving into the reconfiguration of global supply chains but also providing validation to the growing narrative of India as a manufacturing hub, he said. Looking forward, BCG sees potential for India to further enhance its role as a strategic manufacturing and sourcing destination. However, the decision to incorporate India into firms' strategies depends on a complex mix of factors, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution, it says.\",\n",

       " 'VIJAYAWADA: Telugu Desam Party (TDP) national general secretary Nara Lokesh on Thursday alleged that the Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) government is \"trying to kill\" his father and party chief N Chandrababu Naidu in Rajahmundry central jail in Andhra Pradesh’s East Godavari district. It appears that they have planned to \"eliminate Naidu\" in the jail by arresting him in a false case without any evidence and by ensuring that he does not get bail, Lokesh alleges. Lokesh took to microblogging website X on Thursday suspecting that a \"conspiracy is being hatched\" to harm the opposition leader in jail. Mentioning the recent death of a remand prisoner — Ganjeti Veera Venkata Satyanarayana who reportedly died after contracting dengue fever inside the jail — Lokesh expressed concern over the safety of Naidu inside the prison as there are too many mosquitos. He suspected that a plan was being implemented by exposing Naidu to mosquitos so that he would also get vector-borne disease like dengue. The TDP leader said that despite alerting the jail authorities about mosquito menace inside the jail, no action was taken by them. The opposition leader, who is under Z+ category security, was lodged in the jail by implicating him in a false case, he said. Lokesh further said that the chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy would be held responsible if anything happened to Naidu inside the jail.',\n",

       " \"Following their exhilarating triumph in the Asian Champions Trophy, the Indian men's hockey side will be eager to further stamp their continental dominance at the 19th edition of the Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.While India appear to be one of the top favourites to grab the gold by the end of the campaign, history and past records in the respective competition suggest that the third-ranked side in World Men's Hockey currently finds themselves as the third most successful overall when it comes to achieving the coveted feat. Pakistan lead the charge with eight gold medals, South Korea follow them with four, and India are third with three titles won in 1966, 1998 and 2014.India have finished 15 times on the podium overall, with nine defeats in the final resulting in nine strokes of silver beside India's name. Ahead of the hockey extravaganza in Hangzhou this time, TimesofIndia.com spoke to two-time Asian Games medal-winner, Arjuna awardee and former India coach, Jagbir Singh about India's chances of winning gold this time which will see them qualify automatically for the 2024 Paris Olympics. In an exclusive chat with TimesofIndia.com, the former coach of the Indian men's team not only sheds light on India's chances of winning gold this time, but also speaks in detail about the psychological difference between playing in the ACT (Asian Champions Trophy) and the Asian Games as well as the areas the Harmanpreet Singh-led side should be looking to improve in going forward.As a former player and coach, what do you believe are the big strengths of the current Indian hockey team that can be advantageous in the Asian Games?Well, the Indian men's team looks like the most confident side in Asia at the moment. They are mentally very strong and into the game. That's not only because of the current world ranking or the success they had in the Tokyo Olympics. Experience is on their side with one of the most dependable defenders in Harmanpreet, Sreejesh, and Manpreet, to name a few. They have the best penalty-corner conversion rate at the moment. The leading scorer is Harmanpreet for sure. He will be the main man. And also the attacking power which the Indian team has compared to the other Asian teams at the moment; so, these are a few major strengths India have compared to other teams.What are the chances of this team winning the gold in the Asian Games and qualifying for the Olympics next year directly?See, unfortunately, despite having the best side in Asia, India have not been very successful in comparison to the other teams. Let's say Pakistan, they have won more than India, they won it 8 times. After Pakistan and Korea come India, because I remember in 2018, there was no match for India. India crushed all the teams in the pool matches. But unfortunately, because of their overconfidence, they lost in the shootout (to Malaysia). And then, they couldn't even reach the finals. So this is something which worries me. However, I still say that India have the best chance to win the gold. This is how they should work on it and they should approach the tournament. Complacency should be anyway visible, but focus is also important. And they deserve to be the gold medal winners for sure.How different is the mental pressure that players experience in an event like the ACT as compared to a tournament like the Asian Games?A lot more is at stake during the Asian Games, not only because it's the Olympic qualification, but also because they are the Asian champions. When you participate in the Olympic Games as the Asian champions, this gives you more confidence, the team, the body language on the field. This is the difference between the Asian Champions Trophy or the other tournaments and the Asian Games.And this time it's going to be especially different because the Asian Champions Trophy we played in Chennai was at home. So playing at home and winning a tournament and then playing away is also very different. Let's not forget that we had some hiccups, we had some problems during the Asian Champions Trophy playing at home also. We have seen the women's side doing well in major tournaments, what are the chances, according to you, of the women's team at the Asian Games this time?With the variety of players, the mix of experience and youth, the combination which Janneke Schopman has brought in the team. The FIH Cup which they won and then qualified for the Pro League gave them more confidence, even though they didn't have the best outcome during this series or the tournament there. But still, I would say this Indian women's team has the best chances so far compared to the previous Asian Games. Last time, they were unlucky though, they just lost in the finals (to Japan). Otherwise, they were much deserving then also; but this time, they look much stronger because the coach's contribution has been immense. She has done a great job with the team. It's very consistent with the confidence they carry after the Olympic Games and also the recent results against teams like Korea and Japan. They look much stronger this time.Craig Fulton joined the Indian team just a few months back, what is your take on his spell so far?I would say that he's one of the luckiest coaches who has taken over the Indian team so far. When he came in, the team was already over the moon after the Olympic success. The experienced players, most of the experienced players are still part of the team, and this is one of the most combined teams. I would say, at this stage when he took over, he had the opportunity to play a couple of Pro League matches with the team. Now, he already has an existing pool of players, around 30 good players. And he had the Asian Champions Trophy where he could even test his players at the Asian level. Yeah, so far, I'm sure he is looking forward to the Asian Games' success because this is his best chance. Craig is one of those lucky ones, and this success will bring him more confidence before the Olympic games. What was your take on how India handled scoring off PCs as well as via open play in the ACT? Which are the areas you would like to see an improvement in?Well, in a few matches, yes, we were successful (with PCs). But sometimes, I feel we depend a lot on Harmanpreet. And too much dependence on one player and not opting for other variations will invite problems because I remember, in ACT, having more than 12 penalty corners against Japan and not being able to score. We struggled a lot.And even in the final also, we struggled against Malaysia. So yes, this is something which we have to be careful about. We lose focus. We don't play all four quarters consistently as a top team should be playing. Yeah, we tend to switch off at times. And in today's competitive hockey, you don't have even a second to switch off for the entire 60 minutes of play.I could see a lot of unforced errors during the Asian Championships Trophy, which a team like India with the experience they have now, shouldn't be committing. I could see some rush tackles inside the circle, some panic movements inside the defence while defending and also conceding goals against a team like Malaysia, who have always been a problem team when they play India. But still, as a confident side, as a world-ranked number three team when you are playing, there should be a visible difference, which was missing at times. Not taking away the credit for what the Indian team has improved (on) so far, I would still say that these areas need to be addressed.Harmanpreet Singh has recently said in an interview - 'We have the mentality that there is no captain,' - of course, this is a motivating factor because everyone is seen through the same lens and there is no hierarchy, but do you think this kind of statement could be a double-edged sword, given that Harmanpreet does carry the baggage of extra responsibilities?He should have made a better statement. I would say he should have said that everybody should feel the responsibility like a captain. Gone are those days when people would say that team sports need no captains. I would say in today's sport, in today's hockey, you need a captain with command. I remember Sreejesh shouting from the goal line, what to do and what not to do. He still does that.Harmanpreet is one of those very talented defenders India have after a very long time. He is very experienced, very cool, and composed. And the passing skills he has, the elimination passes which he sends for more than 50, 60 yards, not many defenders in the world can do that. And this quality player has to develop more command in captaincy. Definitely, a captain has to take the team along. But you need to have a captain on the pitch. You need to feel that captain's responsibility. And any good player should be very proud to carry that, not only to motivate the youngsters but also to showcase how well he can carry his seniors along. So while he should be open to all ideas, he should know his responsibility.Are there any particular teams that you think Team India should be particularly wary of in the Asian Games this time and why?Malaysia is one of those teams India should be wary of all the time. And I would say China, yes, being the host nation, could have some surprise punches, but overall, it will be Malaysia and Korea, which I am looking at. It shouldn't be a problem against Japan. Not that I would say be overconfident, but yes. Against Malaysia, we need to be very cautious. Also, Korea, with the conversion rate they have in penalty corners and also how they played in the Asian Championship Trophy, remain a top team. They have a better success rate compared to India in the Asian Games. So these are the two teams I would definitely worry about.What specific challenges do Team India need to overcome to perform well in the Asian Games, and how should they address those challenges?I would say inconsistency is one of the very big challenges which India have. We play one match very good, the other match we are not sure how we will perform, and this is one area which is very challenging for the coach to keep his team focused throughout the tournament. Sometimes, we tend to get carried away, which should not be the case. And too much depends on individual players also, especially in terms of penalty corners. Yes, Harman will be one of the key drag-flickers, but we need to have some punches, surprise punches in this tournament.And at no point, this complacency (should set in), I'm repeating the word every time because I saw it happen in 2018 when India scored the maximum number of goals ever in the history of the Asian Games. But we lost the gold medal which we were hunting for, even though we knew we were the best. This is one area. And at times when I read in the interviews where people say that nobody can beat India, nobody can defeat India, I would say India have to challenge themselves every time when they are on the pitch.Are there any emerging talents that you think will play a significant role in India's performance in the tournament this time?Yes, Indian team, they would be looking at Sanjay, whom they have brought in for a major tournament. (We also have) very dependable goalkeepers. Pathak is one of those great goalkeepers who is just ready to take on any challenge anytime. He is much better now in penalty shootouts.All are equally talented. Abhishek coming in with Mandeep's scoring skills, Sukhjeet and now Lalit with dribbles and the ability to make penalty corners with ease; I think overall the Indian team package is a very good combination, even though I was surprised with Akashdeep not being part of the team. But ultimately, it's the coach's call and he knows how he has to utilise the players. So it is not about naming one or two, I would say the entire team is a good set of combinations.Are there any particular strategies that you would like to see India adopting in the Asian Games? Both in defence and attack.India need to show more flow in their attack, more combined moves, fast switchovers, which they have done in a couple of matches, and so many other things which as a coach, I'm sure, Craig would be the better person to prepare his strategies.So the strategy is always from match to match, and team to team, and every quarter, depending upon the situation. So not very specific. But yes, I would hate to see the Indian team chasing goals and failing, then trying to rush.They are the better side. They are the confident side. Now they have played numerous matches. They have got the best exposure before the Asian games, compared to the other teams. So, yes, they should just go ahead.In case Team India don't win the men's gold, they will have to play the qualifiers for the 2024 Olympics. Is that going to add extra pressure on Team India?God forbid, if the worst has to happen and India don't qualify for the Olympics directly after winning the gold, I would still say that India would be there in Paris. I don't see any reason why India shouldn't be there.I would be the unhappiest person on earth if India don't win the Gold in the Asian Games because they are the best side. It's just about clicking and focusing completely on the very day. Forget about the world rankings. Forget about the best drag-flicker you had. Forget about the best goalkeeper you have or the midfielders like Hardik or Manpreet you have. You have the best attacking skills or scoring power in Manpreet and Abhishek and others. But still, I would say, just keep your focus. Asian games first; talk about the Olympics later.\",\n",

       " 'While the 20th-century shonen classics like ‘Fist Of The North Star’ and ‘Dragon Ball’ laid the foundation for today\\'s shonen anime landscape, it was the \"big three\" that truly elevated the genre to new heights. These three series redefined the essence of shonen, introducing or reinventing core elements like the power of friendship, the importance of hard work, and the sting of betrayal.‘Naruto’, in particular, boasts a myriad of iconic scenes within Masashi Kishimoto\\'s magnum opus that played a pivotal role in shaping the modern shonen manga and anime landscape. While drawing inspiration from its predecessors, ‘Naruto’ brought fresh and bold ideas that either solidified shonen conventions or elevated them to unprecedented levels.When Naruto’s sympathetic words redeemed GaaraIn shonen anime, protagonists often use both physical force and heartfelt words to persuade foes to become allies, but none execute it quite like ‘Naruto’. This phenomenon, often dubbed \"talk jutsu,\" showcased Naruto\\'s unique ability to win over adversaries. While he had previously employed it with Zabuza and Neji Hyuga, the defining moment came during his battle with Gaara. Gaara, perceived by all as an irredeemable monster, was convinced to change his ways by Naruto\\'s empathetic words as a fellow jinchuriki.When Shikamaru only used his brain to fight TemariRight from the beginning,‘Naruto’ emphasized the importance of ninja-style cunning over sheer strength, exemplified by tactics like Naruto and Sasuke\\'s clever teamwork against Zabuza and Naruto\\'s clone strategy in the Forest of Death. However, this theme truly flourished when the brilliant Shikamaru Nara faced off against Temari in the Chunin Exams. This battle showcased Shikamaru relying solely on his intelligence, refraining from causing harm even when he had the upper hand. It emphasized the concept that Naruto\\'s characters were true ninjas, distinct from the brute force fighters seen in other series.When Madara Uchiha single-handedly fought with an entire armyWhile numerous shonen villains have showcased their dominance by taking on multiple heroes simultaneously, such as Sosuke Aizen in ‘Bleach’ or All For One in ‘My Hero Academia’, Naruto Shippuden took this concept to an extraordinary level. The formidable Madara Uchiha engaged not just an elite ninja squad or even the five Kage; he faced an entire united shinobi army single-handedly and without any weaponry. This unparalleled display of superiority was a spectacle to behold.When Naruto and Sasuke fought in the Final ValleyShonen anime often portrays the transformation of an enemy into a friend, as seen with characters like Vegeta and Kazuma Kuwabara. However, Naruto took a different route, delivering a dramatic plot twist as Sasuke Uchiha, initially Naruto\\'s rival in Team 7, abandoned his comrades in pursuit of power at any cost. Naruto\\'s pursuit and confrontation with Sasuke in the Final Valley showcased the emotional impact of betrayal. This iconic moment illustrated how a character could transition from friend to foe, laying the foundation for the entirety of Naruto Shippuden.When Pain challenged Naruto with the cycle of hatredVengeance is a recurring theme in shonen anime, with both heroes and villains driven by it, as exemplified by Kurapika Kurta in ‘Hunter x Hunter’. Naruto delved into this theme on a grand scale through the character of Pain, who embodied the relentless cycle of hatred. Pain sought to impart a crucial lesson to the world about this never-ending cycle, challenging Naruto\\'s own quest for revenge following the destruction of the Hidden Leaf Village.',\n",

       " 'BENGALURU: A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Bengaluru on Wednesday held two Jamaat-Ul-Mujahideen (JMB) members from West Bengal guilty of carrying out terror-related activities in and around the city and sentenced them to seven-year rigorous imprisonment with fines. In all, the special court has so far convicted 10 men from West Bengal in terrorism-related cases. The case, investigated and charge-sheeted by the NIA, saw the names of 12 accused men. One is still at large while another accused is in Kolkata prison, facing trial in other cases. The latest convicted men are Asif Iqbal alias Nadeem alias Faisal alias Kasim, 27, of Laxmijola village in Murshidabad district and Mohammed Dilwar Hossain alias Umar alias Arman alias Ali Hasan alias Nurul Hasan, 31, of Dakshin Deoyan Tola in Malda district. According to NIA charge-sheet, Asif is arrayed as accused number-3 while Hossain is accused number eight. Passing the orders special judge CM Gangadhara directed Asif to pay Rs 36,000 and Hossain Rs 33,000 as fine amount.Special public prosecutor Prasanna Kumar P stated that Asif and Hossain had carried out explosions in Bodh Gaya and Jharkhand before arriving in the city.“The accused are members of the JMB. These accused had caused an explosion at Bodhgaya and Jharkand and fled from there and came to Bengaluru. They used to commit robbery and dacoity and they used the proceeds of robbery and dacoity for terror funding. They had prepared Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) to cause explosions in Bengaluru which were recovered from their hideouts at Chikkabanavara,” Kumar said.The NIA charge-sheet narrated that Asif was involved in recruitment of youth to join JMB in India. “He hatched to commit dacoity and used to keep the account of all the items looted by his associates in Bengaluru during 2018. He procured explosive, chemical and electronic equipment to impart training to JMB members. He provided shelter to Arif Hussain alias Mota Anas (Convicted in the same case). In 2018, he assisted BD Arif alias Nasim (Convicted in the same case) in crossing the Indo-Bangla border, with the help of cattle smugglers,” it read.Further, on Hossain’s role, the charge sheet explained “Hossain is involved in the conspiracy strengthening activities of JMB, to carry out subversive activities and spread the ideology of JMB in India. He also procured three pistols and one local made gun for Jihadi activities of JMB members. He planted one Improvised Explosive Device (IED) in Bodhgaya temple complex on January 19, 2018 and fled to Bengaluru to take shelter and evade arrest. While staying in Bengaluru, he along with his JMB associates committed dacoity in various places in Bengaluru to raise fund for the activities of JMB organization in India on the pretext of “Maal-e-Ganimat”,” the charge sheet read.',\n",

       " 'Bollywood actor Sonam Kapoor will return as the brand ambassador for Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival\\'s market initiative \\'Word to Screen\\'. The Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival is back with its on-ground edition after a gap of three years. It will take place from October 27 to November 5 here. \\'Word to Screen\\' is an options market that offers a unique platform to writers, publishers, and filmmakers to engage and option stories for various film formats, according to the organisers. A first-of-its-kind initiative, Word to Screen, was launched in 2016 by Jio MAMI and has since served as a dynamic and inclusive platform that explores the synergy between the power of the written word and the magic of cinema. Kapoor, known for films like \"Neerja\", \"Veere Di Wedding\" and \"Aisha\", said the \\'Word to Screen\\' initiative can be a great platform for narrating compelling stories. \"As actors, we are constantly looking for compelling, disruptive and engaging stories that touch the hearts of the people. By supporting a platform like Word to Screen, I am taking a step towards ensuring the industry benefits from this initiative and we tell a lot more meaningful stories to our audience. \"As a voracious reader, I understand the power of an incredible story and how a well-written book can form the backbone of a compelling film narrative,\" the 38-year-old actor said in a statement. Kapoor would announce nominations for the Book on Cinema award at the Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival event. She urged publishers, writers, and creators to make the most of this platform. \"I am excited to discuss the power of the story in cinema with authors and filmmakers at the event, exchange ideas, and hopefully be a catalyst to contribute to our industry that has given me so much,\" she said. As per the press statement, some of the books that have been optioned out of the Word to Screen market include \"Bhujia Barons\" by Pavitra Kumar, \"Indira\" by Sagarika Ghose, the \"Inspector Saralkar\" series by Salil Desai, \"Strangers to Ourselves\" by Shashi Deshpande, \"The Ivory Throne\" by Manu S Pillai, \"The Spectacular Miss\" by Sonia Bahl, \"How I Became A Farmer\\'s Wife\" by Yashodhara Lal, and \"Cold Truth\" by Nikhil Pradhan.

Scott Fitzgerald\\'s \"This Side of Paradise\" introduces the protagonist, Amory Blaine, who claims to know himself but implies that his self-knowledge is limited. The emotional intensity of the line suggests that self-examination is a deeply emotional process for Amory.

       " 'While the 20th-century shonen classics like ‘Fist Of The North Star’ and ‘Dragon Ball’ laid the foundation for today\\'s shonen anime landscape, it was the \"big three\" that truly elevated the genre to new heights. These three series redefined the essence of shonen, introducing or reinventing core elements like the power of friendship, the importance of hard work, and the sting of betrayal.‘Naruto’, in particular, boasts a myriad of iconic scenes within Masashi Kishimoto\\'s magnum opus that played a pivotal role in shaping the modern shonen manga and anime landscape. While drawing inspiration from its predecessors, ‘Naruto’ brought fresh and bold ideas that either solidified shonen conventions or elevated them to unprecedented levels.When Naruto’s sympathetic words redeemed GaaraIn shonen anime, protagonists often use both physical force and heartfelt words to persuade foes to become allies, but none execute it quite like ‘Naruto’. This phenomenon, often dubbed \"talk jutsu,\" showcased Naruto\\'s unique ability to win over adversaries. While he had previously employed it with Zabuza and Neji Hyuga, the defining moment came during his battle with Gaara. Gaara, perceived by all as an irredeemable monster, was convinced to change his ways by Naruto\\'s empathetic words as a fellow jinchuriki.When Shikamaru only used his brain to fight TemariRight from the beginning,‘Naruto’ emphasized the importance of ninja-style cunning over sheer strength, exemplified by tactics like Naruto and Sasuke\\'s clever teamwork against Zabuza and Naruto\\'s clone strategy in the Forest of Death. However, this theme truly flourished when the brilliant Shikamaru Nara faced off against Temari in the Chunin Exams. This battle showcased Shikamaru relying solely on his intelligence, refraining from causing harm even when he had the upper hand. It emphasized the concept that Naruto\\'s characters were true ninjas, distinct from the brute force fighters seen in other series.When Madara Uchiha single-handedly fought with an entire armyWhile numerous shonen villains have showcased their dominance by taking on multiple heroes simultaneously, such as Sosuke Aizen in ‘Bleach’ or All For One in ‘My Hero Academia’, Naruto Shippuden took this concept to an extraordinary level. The formidable Madara Uchiha engaged not just an elite ninja squad or even the five Kage; he faced an entire united shinobi army single-handedly and without any weaponry. This unparalleled display of superiority was a spectacle to behold.When Naruto and Sasuke fought in the Final ValleyShonen anime often portrays the transformation of an enemy into a friend, as seen with characters like Vegeta and Kazuma Kuwabara. However, Naruto took a different route, delivering a dramatic plot twist as Sasuke Uchiha, initially Naruto\\'s rival in Team 7, abandoned his comrades in pursuit of power at any cost. Naruto\\'s pursuit and confrontation with Sasuke in the Final Valley showcased the emotional impact of betrayal. This iconic moment illustrated how a character could transition from friend to foe, laying the foundation for the entirety of Naruto Shippuden.When Pain challenged Naruto with the cycle of hatredVengeance is a recurring theme in shonen anime, with both heroes and villains driven by it, as exemplified by Kurapika Kurta in ‘Hunter x Hunter’. Naruto delved into this theme on a grand scale through the character of Pain, who embodied the relentless cycle of hatred. Pain sought to impart a crucial lesson to the world about this never-ending cycle, challenging Naruto\\'s own quest for revenge following the destruction of the Hidden Leaf Village.',\n",

He recently emerged as the top run-scorer in the Asia Cup, amassing 302 runs in five matches with an impressive average of 75.50 and a strike rate of 93.50.\"He\\'ll be one of the most important players at the World Cup. I know that he wants to be a superstar and wants to be the next Virat Kohli and is in that aura already and after this World Cup, we will be talking about him more often,\" said Raina on JioCinema.The first ODI against Australia on Friday at the PCA Stadium in Mohali holds special significance for Gill, as it marks his debut in playing an international match at his home ground.Drawing parallels to the past, Raina, who was a crucial part of India\\'s triumphant 2011 World Cup-winning team, envisions Gill replicating the kind of batting prowess displayed by captain Rohit Sharma in the 2019 World Cup, where he emerged as the tournament\\'s leading run-scorer.\"The form he\\'s playing in with his hand speed - it\\'s extremely strong. Spinners don\\'t know where to bowl to him and if fast bowlers don\\'t swing the ball, he can play those really well with a straight or a flick.\"\"His mindset will not stop here. What Rohit Sharma did in the 2019 World Cup; Gill could do the same for India this year. He\\'ll get 50 overs to bat, so it\\'s a takeoff point for his batting.

       " 'NEW DELHI: Canadian PM Justin Trudeau\\'s security personnel sent jitters through the intelligence machinery here after they refused to let their \"protectee\" stay in the presidential suite that had been specially furbished by the Indian security establishment as per security protocols laid down for heads of state for the G20 summit that concluded recently, sources said. Sources in the security establishment said the hotel, Lalit in central Delhi, where Trudeau was staying had installed an advanced security shield comprising bulletproof glass with a thick layer of polycarbonate plastic which can even stop sniper bullets. Other security equipment were installed as well as part of a foolproof arrangement.However, Trudeau\\'s delegation decided not to stay in the suite and instead opted for normal rooms, sending Indian security officials into a tizzy. Multiple rounds of negotiations followed in the next few hours during which Indian sleuths insisted that the protocols be followed to help ensure security. However, they had to back off after the Canadian side didn\\'t budge, and allow Trudeau to stay in a normal room as the final call in such matters rests with the visitor dignitary and his embassy. It has been learnt that the Canadians offered to pay for the presidential suite as well despite staying in regular rooms.Sources speculated that Trudeau could have been just following the instructions of his security team which may have had their own apprehensions in the wake of the tense relationship between the two countries. There was high drama after the summit as Trudeau could leave for Canada only after a delay of 36 hours as his aircraft reported a malfunction. He was supposed to leave on the night of September 10 (a Sunday) but the technical snag left him stranded. The issue was discovered during the pre-flight inspection of the aircraft, prompting the authorities to ground the Airbus plane. The Canadian PM left on Tuesday afternoon after the glitch was rectified and the aircraft was cleared to fly. This was, however, not the first instance of Trudeau\\'s plane suffering a malfunction.

       " \"NEW DELHI: Team India prepares to face Australia in a crucial three-game series that doubles as the final dress rehearsal before the impending ICC ODI World Cup. With stalwarts Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Kuldeep Yadav, and Hardik Pandya taking a break for the initial matches, it's a pivotal moment for head coach Rahul Dravid to assess India's bench strength.Amidst this high-stakes encounter, two Mumbai-based batsmen, Shreyas Iyer and Suryakumar Yadav, are locked in personal battles to secure their places in the all-important World Cup squad.Iyer's fitnessShreyas Iyer, at the age of 28, stands at a crossroads in his career. Limited cricketing action in the last six months due to a stress fracture surgery has raised concerns about his match fitness. A recent episode of a stiff back just before an Asia Cup match against Pakistan added to the worries. While chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar has given the green light for Iyer to participate in the three-game series, the true test lies in whether his body can withstand the demands of playing 100 overs over the next five days.Iyer's reputation as a formidable batter of spin bowling in the middle overs could be an invaluable asset for India in the upcoming World Cup.Suryakumar's ODI aspirationsMeanwhile, Suryakumar Yadav, popularly known as 'SKY,' has soared in T20Is, but he faces the challenge of carving a niche for himself in the realm of ODI cricket. Despite having 27 ODIs under his belt, his average of less than 25 begs the question of his suitability in the 50-over format. While he may not be a regular starter in the World Cup XI, he's determined to convince the team management of his worth.The emergence of young talent Tilak Varma puts pressure on Suryakumar's position, and at the age of 33, this may be his final opportunity to feature in a 50-over World Cup.'Ash' gets a chanceAn unexpected door has opened for the seasoned 37-year-old Ravichandran Ashwin due to a small quadriceps tear suffered by left-arm spinner Axar Patel. If Axar doesn't recover in time, Ashwin could make his third and potentially final appearance in a 50-over World Cup.Remarkably, just two weeks ago, Ashwin wasn't even in contention, but now he finds himself in competition with his younger state-mate Washington Sundar for a spot in the squad. Recent buzz suggests that Ashwin, even if he doesn't perform exceptionally well in the upcoming matches, stands a better chance of inclusion compared to Washington. The prospect of Ashwin locking horns with David Warner and Steve Smith promises to be a treat for cricket enthusiasts.The absence of Kuldeep Yadav and Hardik Pandya presents both Ashwin and Washington with an opportunity to showcase their skills to the team.However, it's important to note that even if Ashwin excels, the team management may opt for Axar if he regains fitness in time for the third ODI. Typically, a small tear takes around two weeks to heal, and for a spinner, it is a less severe injury compared to fast bowlers, who require more time to recover. India remains optimistic about Axar's fitness ahead of the World Cup.Team composition and bowler workloadWith Rohit Sharma absent from the top order, Ishan Kishan is likely to open alongside Shubman Gill, while Shreyas Iyer fills in for Virat Kohli, who needs valuable game time. The workload management of fast bowlers, particularly Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, will be a key consideration given the tight schedule, including three 50-over games in five days and travel commitments.Australia, the team to beat in WCAustralia, despite a recent 2-3 series loss to South Africa, remain a formidable team. Their victory in the last ODI series in India in March and their track record of success in subcontinental conditions make them strong contenders for the World Cup. Worth noting is that India and Australia will clash again on October 8 during the marquee event.Australia's bowling attack faces a stern test on subcontinent pitches known for favouring batsmen.SquadIndia: KL Rahul (C WK), Ravindra Jadeja (Vice-captain), Ruturaj Gaikwad, Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Ishan Kishan (wicketkeeper), Shardul Thakur, Washington Sundar, R Ashwin, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd.

But it was an error by the bank. He managed to transfer Rs 21,000 to a friend before the rest of the amount was taken back by the bank in under 30 minutes.Rajkumar, a native of Neikkarapatti village near Palani, had rented a room at Kodambakkam with his cab driver friends. \"After a long day at work, I took a short nap in the afternoon (on September 9).

However, a few minutes down the line, the balance amount was debited by the bank. The next morning, TMB officials from Thoothukudi contacted him and told that the money was credited by mistake. They requested Rajkumar not to withdraw more money.When one of the officials threatened to file a police complaint, he went to the bank\\'s T Nagar branch with an advocate where both sides reached a compromise. \"The bank said that I need not return the amount I withdrew so far, and has offered me a car loan,\" said Rajkumar.',\n",

In an exclusive interview with DNA, he opened up about the overwhelming response to Jawan, his future projects, and addressed some of the criticism the film has received.The director, known for his blockbuster Tamil films, shared his perspective on the remarkable journey from \"Raja Rani\" to \"Jawan.\" Despite the increasing scale of his projects, Atlee emphasised that he doesn\\'t follow a fixed formula but instead listens to his heart and relies on his supportive friends and family. He expressed gratitude for his wife, who plays a significant role in his progress.Atlee\\'s transition to Bollywood with \"Jawan\" has been a game-changer, as the film races towards the remarkable milestone of Rs 1000 crore at the worldwide box office.

       " \"The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has submitted a proposed regulation relating to modernisation of the H-1B visa program to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. This is the first step in the regulatory process and the entire process including calling for public opinions will take several months prior to finalisation of the rule.The proposed rule is likely to amend several aspects of the H-1B program, including amending the definition of the employer-employee relationship, establishing site visit requirements and guidelines for agency officials, addressing the F-1 (student visa) cap-gap issue, and increasing anti-fraud safeguards in the H-1B cap e-registration system. The Biden administration's first bi-annual agenda rolled out in June 2021 had mentioned many of these aspects as agenda items.The proposed rule is slated for publication in the Federal Register in December 2023, post which there will be an open window of 30-60 days for inviting public comments. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the new rules will kick in, in time for the forthcoming H-1B cap filing season which will typically open in March 2024. Of the annual quota of 85,000 H-1B cap visas, Indians especially those in the technology sector, bag a large chunk of the visa allotment.According to Mitch Wexler, partner at Fragomen, a global immigration law firm, “The high number of E-registration for H-1B cap visas submitted this March, for the fiscal ended September 2024 had prompted USCIS to suspect misuse, investigations were carried out and referrals were made to law enforcement authorities. The proposed H-1B rule is expected to introduce measures designed to reduce the potential for misuse so that this incident is not repeated.”As reported by TOI in its edition of April 30, USCIS stated that it received 7,58,994 eligible registrations, a rise of 60% over last year’s eligible registration pool. This led it to suspect gaming of the E-registration mechanism. Gaming happens when a set of sponsoring employers acting in conduit, make multiple registrations for the same individual to increase his/her chances of selection in the lottery, without each such registration having a bonafide job offer.If the proposed rules address the cap-gap issue, it will help the international student community in the US. The term cap-gap refers to the period between the time an international student’s F-1 status ends and the H-1B status begins. International students are eligible for a 12-month (three years for STEM students) optional practical training (OPT) under which they can work in the US. In many cases, the organizations where they are undergoing OPT sponsor them for the H-1B work visa. If the H-1B application is filed in time, they can continue working beyond the expiry date on their OPT employment authorization document, while waiting for the start date (October 1) of an approved or pending H-1B application. However, if the application is not processed by October 1, the student must stop working as of this date. Many students have lost out, because of this late processing and the proposed rule is likely to provide a solution.\",\n",
       " \"Vishal Bharadwaj became part of movies first as a music director and with passing time he tapped into his inner talents and turned into a director and delivered movies like Makdee, Maqbool, Kaminey, Haider etc. The director is now going to make his debut as a director on OTT with Charlie Chopra and The Mystery of Solang Valley which is based on Agatha Christie’s The Sittaford Mystery. Excerpts from interview:You have usually worked on plays written by Shakespeare but for your OTT debut with Charlie Chopra and The Mystery of Solang Valley, you chose to adapt Agatha Christie’s book. So did you get into a fight with Shakespeare this time around?(Laughs) No, it has been about 10 years since I made Haider, last of my tragedy trilogy of Shakespeare’s work. But yes I want to start work on his comedy trilogy soon. Coming to Charlie Chopra, I have been wanting to do a whodunit by Agatha Christie for a very long time. Actually I had taken the rights of the book back in 2019.Earlier I had written a movie script based on the book but the cast that I wanted to make it with and the way I wanted to make it, it was getting difficult to raise money for it . This project would have shut down had I not met up with the creative head of Sony Liv Danish Khan. He mentioned that we haven't worked together and if I would have anything which we can work together on. So I told him I have a film script, but he told me they don't work on films and asked me if I can convert it into a series .The best part of working on a series for a filmmaker is that he doesn't have to let go of his detailing.You and Irrfan Khan had a very close bond. Post his demise, you wrote a screenplay called Irrfan and I, which was printed in Times Of India. Have you ever revisited it after that ?I was very emotionally disturbed when he passed away. I get disturbed even now when I think about Irrfan. Back then I wanted to say something. A lot of people asked me to write for their publication, someone even asked to write a chapter on him, a book was being written on him. I wanted to speak in the language with which Irrfan and I connected, so I attempted the screenplay which showcased our journey . I then showed it to Gulzar saab and he was moved, he asked me to write more about it. It is like a biographical relationship between an actor and director and it was cinematic as cinema was my and Irrfan’s language. Writing it was my catharsis. Meghna Gulzar told me to make it into a film or something and I told her I can't do it as I'm a character in it . She suggested she wants to make it or if Aasman, my son, could make it. But sooner or later it should be made. Your son Aasman, made his debut as a director with Kuttey. The film didn’t do well at the box office. How do you look back at his journey?As a father I’m very proud of him that he chose to make such a difficult film as his first film. I think he shouldn’t have done that. Even I attempted Kaminey after I had a couple of films under my belt. It is a difficult genre where a lot is happening in just one night. I never went on the sets because I didn't want anyone to feel that I made it. I was happy that he alone was able to pull it off, people may not have liked the film but I feel he knows his craft.One of your strongest connections in the industry has been Gulzar, how do see your equation with him?I have been very fortunate, I don't know what more I can ask from life. We have been working together for the last 34 years, there was a point when I was hoping to get just one song with him and today we have done over 50 films and 600 songs together.One striking aspect of all your films has been that they are anti-establishment, do you feel it is getting riskier with every passing day ?Yes. I don't think you should even ask this question. Yes, these are difficult times for freedom of speech, but I think we will move out of this phase as well. Nothing is permanent, something or other will change. If not, then change will come in people and who knows that today who are suppressing it, tomorrow they will become liberal.\",\n",

Global Affairs Canada said some diplomats have received threats on social media platforms, part of an unfolding backlash in the South Asian country following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s claims on Monday that Indian government agents assassinated a prominent Sikh leader on Canadian soil. New Delhi has called the allegations “absurd” and denied involvement in the June 19 shooting of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was pushing for an independent Sikh homeland in India. “In the light of the current environment where tensions have heightened, we are taking action to ensure the safety of our diplomats,” Global Affairs Canada said in a statement Thursday. “Out of an abundance of caution, we have decided to temporarily adjust staff presence in India.”',\n",
       " \"Nayanthara is known as the female superstar of south and her latest release Jawan opposite Shah Rukh Khan left fans and critics asking for more. And it would only be wise to assume that she will now be seen in more Hindi films, but it seems like nothing of that sort is happening. Apparently, the actress is not exactly happy with the way her character was showcased in Jawan, and it is all because of director Atlee.As per a report by Hindustan Times, it is being suggested that Nayanthara is quite upset with Atlee because her role was chopped in the film and was sidelined significantly. On the other hand, according to her, Deepika Padukone’s character was elevated.Though Deepika is only credited as a special appearance in the film, to many it didn’t feel that way. The source suggested that Deepika’s role was not a cameo at all and in fact, Jawan was made to look like a SRK- Deepika film. Nayanthara who is a huge star down south, hasn't reportedly taken the snub well, which is the reason why she might not be seen in Bollywood projects as something similar might happen again. However, there is no confirmation to these reports.It is also being suggested that it was because of this reason, she didn’t attend any promotional event of the film pre or post release. However, not many are aware that Nayanthara usually has a no promotion policy and never attends film events. It is believed that since she has had poor experiences earlier during promotions, she stays away from them, she feels that her job is to act and not get involved in promotions.Jawan has set the records for the fastest entry into the 500 crore club in India, the film took 13 days to achieve this feat and is already challenging movies like Gadar 2, Baahubali 2: The Conclusion and Pathaan to occupy the number one spot for the highest grossing film ever.\",\n",

That\\'s what one comes across as a unanimous first impression at the 19th Asian Games, but it\\'s not a surprise when you are at what\\'s regarded as the Artificial Intelligence (AI) headquarters - Hangzhou. And, therefore, not a surprise to witness China promoting the 19th edition of the Asiad as the \\'Smart\\' Games.Hangzhou, in fact, brings together a unique blend of historical landscapes like the West Lake, which has inspired poets as long back as the 9th century and one that has seen it become a world leader in technology.Hangzhou\\'s role in the ancient Silk Road is a major part of its rich cultural heritage, which led to development of civilization that has gone to add that \\'silken\\' touch to its seamless technology-driven living in the modern era, and it is also driving the Games. From the bottom to the top level, the Games paint a picture that at times almost resembles a \\'Technology Fair\\' - at least until the on-field competition completely takes over after the opening ceremony on September 23. A walk through the Main Media Centre (MMC) can leave even the digital freaks overwhelmed. It\\'s literally a \\'Cloud\\' of technology and activity that mesmerizes you. A robot can answer all your banking queries at the Main Media Centre, another one can be seen exhibiting its ability to transfer small goods from one point to another. If you are in the way, it will gently say, \\'please be careful.\\'You can walk into the AI-generated image kiosk to punch keywords of your choice and ask the system to throw up related images that you can then cast on the giant digital curve, or take a walkthrough to learn how AI can revolutionize the broadcast world. Enter the MMC and a giant screen beaming a \\'Cloud\\' of activity across the Games welcomes the accredited media. At the venues, if you are unable to locate your seat, the \\'Smart Hangzhou 2022\\' application will do it for you.The Tonglu Equestrian Centre, intriguingly, has been provided a \\'digital twin\\'. It replicates the arena and uses technology to digitally keep an eye on all the aspects, including energy conservation.Language barriers seem a thing of the past when volunteers not fluent in English push a button on their cell phone and gently extend the device closer to a foreign guest to record his query. The AI-enabled application translates that into Mandarin for the volunteers, who then are ready to guide. \"Regarding intelligent spectator experiences, we have created the first-ever digital spectator service platform called \\'Smart Hangzhou 2022,\\' and introduced Asian Games AR services,\" said Chen Weiqiang, executive secretary-general of the Organizing Committee of the Games, at a press conference.But that\\'s not where it ends. The Games have also incorporated:1. 5G-Advanced: Can transfer data up to 10 times the speed of standard 5G2. Passive IoT (Internet of things): Can monitor environmental temperatures and humidity, tracking of logistics vehicles, warehouse management, asset inventory management and can prevent theft by monitoring valuable assets deployed at the Games venues3.

       " 'NEW DELHI: Amid strains in India-Canada ties, Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday met Home Minister Amit Shah and hoped for a quick resolution to disputes between the two countries, noting that Punjabis in large numbers live there and the deteriorating relations have left them in a state of panic. Badal told reporters after the meeting that it is very disturbing to hear of the woes of Punjabis, including a large number of Sikhs, because of the worsening relations between the two countries. \"There is a sense of panic among Punjabis. Both governments, India\\'s as well as Canada\\'s, should find a solution as soon as possible,\" he said. With India repeatedly conveying its concerns to Canada over Khalistani activities on its soil, Badal said Sikhs have been the most patriotic people who made maximum sacrifices during the independence struggle. The community should not be blamed for what a few persons do, he said. The issues involving the two countries should be settled rather than escalated, he said. There are over 18 lakh Indians in Canada and a large number of them are Punjabis, he noted. India on Thursday \"suspended till further notice\" its visa services in Canada. The move comes amid the escalating diplomatic row that erupted following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\\'s allegations of a \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of a Khalistani separatist in June. India has rejected the charge as absurd. The India-Canada ties have been on a downward spiral in view of increasing activities of the pro-Khalistani elements in the North American country.

       " 'Mithun Chakraborty, the Bollywood icon celebrated for his infectious \"Disco Dancer\" moves, has recently revealed some light-hearted facts about his personal life. His confession revolved around his relationship with his wife, Yogeeta Bali. To many, she is the one who makes the superstar dance, not just on the stage but in life too. Mithun once confessed that his wife had thrown him out of their house in a shocking revelation. This time, he went a step further and jokingly shared how his wife \"beats him up\" regularly. These revelations might seem shocking to some, but they\\'re delivered with a sense of humor and jest, showcasing the playful dynamic the couple shares. Mithun, who graces the stage of ‘Dance Bangla Dance’ as the Mahaguru, frequently engages in light banter with the show\\'s anchor, Ankush. An amusing incident from the show that went viral earlier this year captures this playful spirit. A clip shared on the channel\\'s Instagram showed Ankush teasingly pointing towards Mithun and informing a young participant, \"You see him? His wife beats him up daily!\" To which Mithun responded with pride, hinting that if he denied this claim, the repercussions from his wife would be far worse! The audience, including celebrities like Subhashree Ganguly, Srabanti Chatterjee, and Mouni Roy, burst into laughter. Further highlighting the playful banter, Mithun then gestured to a man sitting next to his wife and quipped, \"Hey there! Seems like we\\'re on the same boat.\" He humorously advised the man, drawing from his own experiences, about the importance of never crossing one\\'s spouse, even as a superstar. When Mithun entered Bollywood, Yogeeta Bali, a more seasoned actress than him back then, played an instrumental role in molding his career. Yogeeta, the niece of Geeta Bali and formerly married to the legendary Kishore Kumar, tied the knot with Mithun in 1979, a year after her divorce. The couple has experienced their fair share of highs and lows over their 44-year marriage. Yet, they remain a unit. Even though Yogeeta is less visible in public these days, she keeps a close tab on Mithun\\'s activities, something the actor lovingly acknowledges.Meanwhile, on the work front, Mithun Chakraborty has already started shooting for his next Bengali film \\'Kabuliwala\\', directed by Suman Ghosh. The film is based on Rabindranath Thakur\\'s famous novel of the same name and will be directed by Suman Ghosh, who previously worked with Mithun in the Bengali film \\'Nobel Chor\\'.

And, therefore, not a surprise to witness China promoting the 19th edition of the Asiad as the \\'Smart\\' Games.Hangzhou, in fact, brings together a unique blend of historical landscapes like the West Lake, which has inspired poets as long back as the 9th century and one that has seen it become a world leader in technology.Hangzhou\\'s role in the ancient Silk Road is a major part of its rich cultural heritage, which led to development of civilization that has gone to add that \\'silken\\' touch to its seamless technology-driven living in the modern era, and it is also driving the Games. From the bottom to the top level, the Games paint a picture that at times almost resembles a \\'Technology Fair\\' - at least until the on-field competition completely takes over after the opening ceremony on September 23. A walk through the Main Media Centre (MMC) can leave even the digital freaks overwhelmed. It\\'s literally a \\'Cloud\\' of technology and activity that mesmerizes you. A robot can answer all your banking queries at the Main Media Centre, another one can be seen exhibiting its ability to transfer small goods from one point to another. If you are in the way, it will gently say, \\'please be careful.\\'You can walk into the AI-generated image kiosk to punch keywords of your choice and ask the system to throw up related images that you can then cast on the giant digital curve, or take a walkthrough to learn how AI can revolutionize the broadcast world. Enter the MMC and a giant screen beaming a \\'Cloud\\' of activity across the Games welcomes the accredited media. At the venues, if you are unable to locate your seat, the \\'Smart Hangzhou 2022\\' application will do it for you.The Tonglu Equestrian Centre, intriguingly, has been provided a \\'digital twin\\'. It replicates the arena and uses technology to digitally keep an eye on all the aspects, including energy conservation.Language barriers seem a thing of the past when volunteers not fluent in English push a button on their cell phone and gently extend the device closer to a foreign guest to record his query. The AI-enabled application translates that into Mandarin for the volunteers, who then are ready to guide. \"Regarding intelligent spectator experiences, we have created the first-ever digital spectator service platform called \\'Smart Hangzhou 2022,\\' and introduced Asian Games AR services,\" said Chen Weiqiang, executive secretary-general of the Organizing Committee of the Games, at a press conference.But that\\'s not where it ends.

Passive IoT (Internet of things): Can monitor environmental temperatures and humidity, tracking of logistics vehicles, warehouse management, asset inventory management and can prevent theft by monitoring valuable assets deployed at the Games venues3. Driverless buses: Uses autonomous driving technology (in service at the co-host city of Deqing, between the Sports Center Gymnasium and the Geographic Information Town Basketball Court) Not far in the future, the \\'China Artificial Intelligence Town\\' in Hangzhou will stand to testify the city\\'s leading presence on the world technology map.

The new stretch of expressway, led to a reduction of 2 hours travel time between Delhi and Jaipur. Once completed, the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway will cut across six states, including Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Here are some latest updates on the current progress of the massive project. Latest development:The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) recently issued a public notice, listing the fee structures for vehicles plying on seven stretches across Madhya Pradesh (MP). The Madhya Pradesh part of the Expressway is being completed in nine stages and will stretch between the 220 kilometre 220 to kilometre marker to 720 km marker on the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, once it is completed. 244 km stretch inaugurated in MP between Jhabua to Jhalawar:NHAI has formally inaugurated the 244 km stretch between Madhya Pradesh's Jhabua to Rajashtan's Modak, near Jhalawar, on September 20. The new stretch of expressway passes through Jhabua, Mandsaur and Ratlam districts in Madhya Pradesh and will connect major cities, including Garoth, Jaora, Ratlam, and Thandla in the state.Is the Expressway between Jhabua (MP) to Delhi complete? Not reallyAccording to HV Kumar, Indian highway and automotive expert, the drive from Jhabua to Delhi cannot be made completely on the Expressway yet. Between the journey from Jhabua to Delhi, travellers will need to exit the expressway at Modak and follow the Ujjain - Kota - Tonk - Lalsot (old route). Vehicles again have the option of re-entering the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway from the Lalsot on ramp to reach Delhi (Sohna Road). Expert, HV Kumar further reported that the patch between leaving the expressway at Modak and catching it again at Lalsot, is not an easy drive. While the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway between Delhi to Lalsot in Rajasthan (South of Jaipur) has been operational since February, HV Kumar reports that the section between Rajasthan's Lalsot and Sawai has also been completed now, however, it is not open to the public yet. We can expect the stretch to open soon and offer a higher stretch of uninterrupted travel on the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway. When will the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway get completed?The foundation stone for the massive road network project was laid in March 2019 and the deadline for completion is by December 2024.\",\n",

Playing three games in five days is not easy, a lot of ice baths, eat good food and get ready.\"India will next play Myanmar, who beat Bangladesh 1-0 on the opening day.India had a great chance of scoring from a free kick after Gurkirat Singh was fouled near the Bangladesh box.Samuel Kynshi took the free-kick after getting some advice from Chhetri, but his shot to the top-left corner was brilliantly saved by the Bangladesh custodian, who dived to palm the ball away.After a goalless first half, India had another chance to score but Rahul KP could not make use of the cross inside the box as he headed it the other way.There were three changes for India as Gurmeet Singh, who received a yellow card in last game, was replaced by Dheeraj Singh. The two other changes were Rohit Danu for Rahim Ali and Chingelsena Singh for Sumit Rathi.(With PTI Inputs)',\n",

       " \"Lohum, producer of lithium-ion battery materials through recycling and repurposing in India, has signed a partnership agreement with Nepal, to deliver 25,000 metric tonnes of EV battery materials by 2028. Nepal is currently in the process of finding solutions to upscale its clean energy capacity across the board. Chinese battery material imports currently dominate the Nepal market, however, the solution that its new partnership with Lohum presents, will help it to increase its clean energy without sacrificing on its sovereignty, economy or natural resources. Under the guidelines of the partnership, Lohum will recycle and repurpose an estimated 200,000 batteries in Nepal and extract re-usable EV battery material such as lithium, nickel and cobalt to the tune of 25,000 metric tonnes. This will happen over a period of 5 years with an aim to make Nepal energy-abundant and self-sustaining. Nepal’s objective is to take a foundational step towards diversifying its sources of clean energy and move away from its dependence on Chinese materials. The move is also aligned with India's commitment towards affordable and inclusive energy for all nations worldwide and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The partnership with Lohum will further help Nepal’s EV ecosystem and its stakeholders to become compliant with the country’s Aarthik Vidheyak policy for management of end-of-life battery waste, introduced by the Government of Nepal in FY 2023. Moreover, the recycled materials will then recirculate in Nepal’s battery ecosystem indefinitely. In terms of Nepal and its EV ecosystem, major EV manufacturers such as Tata Motors, Citroen and MG are currently selling battery electric vehicles in the neighbouring country. The pool of BEVs in Nepal is projected to grow with incoming models from other major OEMS such as Volkswagen, Suzuki, Renault, and Mahindra Electric. Once, batteries from these cars enter the ecosystem then recycling and repurposing technologies like that of Lohumi, will further help Nepal become clean energy independent.\",\n",

He had said earlier that if the systems survived the night and they are able to wake up again, that process would happen automatically. Sunrise on Moon happened early Wednesday but Vikram and Pragyan would need the right Sun elevation angle to warm up again and wake up. “The optimal Sun elevation angle for systems to work would be 6° to 9°. The temperature has to rise above a certain threshold too. For the wake up, we need power generation and temperature on the elements on Vikram and Pragyan to meet certain criteria. We should know something by September 21 or 22. If they wake up, it’ll wake up during this time,” M Sankaran, director, UR Rao Satellite Centre, the Chandrayaan-3 lead centre, told TOI.

       " 'While the 20th-century shonen classics like ‘Fist Of The North Star’ and ‘Dragon Ball’ laid the foundation for today\\'s shonen anime landscape, it was the \"big three\" that truly elevated the genre to new heights. These three series redefined the essence of shonen, introducing or reinventing core elements like the power of friendship, the importance of hard work, and the sting of betrayal.‘Naruto’, in particular, boasts a myriad of iconic scenes within Masashi Kishimoto\\'s magnum opus that played a pivotal role in shaping the modern shonen manga and anime landscape. While drawing inspiration from its predecessors, ‘Naruto’ brought fresh and bold ideas that either solidified shonen conventions or elevated them to unprecedented levels.When Naruto’s sympathetic words redeemed GaaraIn shonen anime, protagonists often use both physical force and heartfelt words to persuade foes to become allies, but none execute it quite like ‘Naruto’. This phenomenon, often dubbed \"talk jutsu,\" showcased Naruto\\'s unique ability to win over adversaries. While he had previously employed it with Zabuza and Neji Hyuga, the defining moment came during his battle with Gaara. Gaara, perceived by all as an irredeemable monster, was convinced to change his ways by Naruto\\'s empathetic words as a fellow jinchuriki.When Shikamaru only used his brain to fight TemariRight from the beginning,‘Naruto’ emphasized the importance of ninja-style cunning over sheer strength, exemplified by tactics like Naruto and Sasuke\\'s clever teamwork against Zabuza and Naruto\\'s clone strategy in the Forest of Death. However, this theme truly flourished when the brilliant Shikamaru Nara faced off against Temari in the Chunin Exams. This battle showcased Shikamaru relying solely on his intelligence, refraining from causing harm even when he had the upper hand. It emphasized the concept that Naruto\\'s characters were true ninjas, distinct from the brute force fighters seen in other series.When Madara Uchiha single-handedly fought with an entire armyWhile numerous shonen villains have showcased their dominance by taking on multiple heroes simultaneously, such as Sosuke Aizen in ‘Bleach’ or All For One in ‘My Hero Academia’, Naruto Shippuden took this concept to an extraordinary level. The formidable Madara Uchiha engaged not just an elite ninja squad or even the five Kage; he faced an entire united shinobi army single-handedly and without any weaponry. This unparalleled display of superiority was a spectacle to behold.When Naruto and Sasuke fought in the Final ValleyShonen anime often portrays the transformation of an enemy into a friend, as seen with characters like Vegeta and Kazuma Kuwabara. However, Naruto took a different route, delivering a dramatic plot twist as Sasuke Uchiha, initially Naruto\\'s rival in Team 7, abandoned his comrades in pursuit of power at any cost. Naruto\\'s pursuit and confrontation with Sasuke in the Final Valley showcased the emotional impact of betrayal. This iconic moment illustrated how a character could transition from friend to foe, laying the foundation for the entirety of Naruto Shippuden.When Pain challenged Naruto with the cycle of hatredVengeance is a recurring theme in shonen anime, with both heroes and villains driven by it, as exemplified by Kurapika Kurta in ‘Hunter x Hunter’. Naruto delved into this theme on a grand scale through the character of Pain, who embodied the relentless cycle of hatred. Pain sought to impart a crucial lesson to the world about this never-ending cycle, challenging Naruto\\'s own quest for revenge following the destruction of the Hidden Leaf Village.',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: India\\'s run-machine Virat Kohli is back to his best ahead of the ICC ODI World Cup, which begins next month. Virat, who for years carried the dual responsibilities of captaincy and batting, has undergone significant changes in his batting approach recently. He\\'s become more daring, taking calculated risks and his hunger for big runs is also back.One unforgettable moment in this post-captaincy phase was his iconic innings against Pakistan in the T20 World Cup, where he played a stunning unbeaten knock of 82* off 53 balls, one of the finest performances of his career. Virat\\'s love affair with Pakistan continued in the recent Asia Cup too as he notched up his 47th ODI century against the Green Shirts, leaving him just three hundreds shy of breaking legendary Sachin Tendulkar\\'s record of 49 ODI tons. So, is Virat batting more freely now, and has relinquishing captaincy allowed him to become a much more focused batter?According to India\\'s senior spinner Amit Mishra, giving up the captaincy was a blessing for Virat.\"He is playing freely. Since he has quit his captaincy and Rohit became the captain, Virat is playing freely. He is now focussing and concentrating on his batting. With this, there is a lot of improvement in his batting,” Mishra, who is a cricket expert for JioCinema, told Timesofindia.com in an interview. \"When you are a captain, you have to focus on both aspects - your team and your batting. Now Virat is no longer a captain and his sole focus is on his batting. Since he left the captaincy, his batting has improved. He is the same Virat we saw a few years back [before the lean phase]. He is giving the same glimpse,\" Mishra said. (AP Photo) Virat stepped down from T20I captaincy after the conclusion of the T20 World Cup in October 2021 and was then relieved from ODI captaincy ahead of the South Africa tour in December later that year. Virat gave up Test captaincy less than 24 hours after India lost a series in South Africa in January 2022.\"Virat is enjoying his batting, scoring runs, always smiling, having fun on the field, and speaking to other team members. He is in a very good frame of mind currently,\" Mishra added. \\'IMPORTANT BREAK FOR VIRAT, ROHIT\\'There was considerable surprise and debate among fans and former cricketers when the selectors made the decision to rest key players like Virat, captain Rohit Sharma, and all-rounder Hardik Pandya for the first two ODIs of the upcoming three-match series against Australia.Virat, Rohit, and Pandya are the part of India squad for the third ODI.Is it justifiable to rest these star players during an ODI series, especially when it could serve as valuable preparation for the forthcoming ICC World Cup, set to commence on October 5?

       " \"In 2018, civic authorities in Mumbai conceived an ambitious bicycle track plan. The idea was to provide the city's commute and recreational cyclists with safe stretches.Five years on, Mumbai's cyclists say the project's execution has largely been a disappointment. The isolated and disjointed tracks have failed to meet their objective, they say.Commute cyclists have no use for the tracks as they often lead from nowhere to nowhere. In most cases, they do not provide critical connectivity to train and metro stations or even bus stands.Meanwhile, most recreational cyclists, who like going on long rides, avoid these tracks as they are not continuous and obstacle-free.At some locations, the cycle tracks have been taken over by parked taxis or bikers trying to get ahead in heavy traffic. At others, pedestrians walk on cycle tracks because the adjacent footpaths are not fit for use. As a result, cyclists are pushed onto the roads to deal with heavy motorized traffic. Even our bus and autorickshaw stands are on the left side of the road, and cause breaks in cycle tracks.Experts say pedestrian amenities must be improved to keep the cycle tracks free of pedestrians. Also, adding cycle tracks to existing roads may be difficult, but all new roads and bridges being planned should factor in space for cycle tracks. There are also some radical ideas like moving the cycle tracks from the left of the road to the medians in the middle of the roads, or pop-up tracks that can be set up at particular times.Moreover, change in mindset also has a big role to play. Cyclists complain that other motorists often see them as slow-moving nuisances, and feel the money invested in cycling infrastructure should instead be used to make pothole-free roads.

       " 'NEW DELHI: Ever since Mohammed Siraj claimed a six-wicket haul against Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup final, accolades for the Indian pacer continue to pour in with AB de Villiers also lavishing praise on the top-ranked ODI bowler.Former South African captain de Villiers emphasised that Siraj\\'s attitude makes him stands apart and it is one thing that can really uplift you.\"He\\'s still young even though we\\'ve been seeing him for ages. We are very familiar with that face and that bowling action. What stands out for him is his attitude, we\\'ve spoken about this before on this series. Attitude can really uplift you. If you never give up, if you make your attitude catch up with your teammates, the fans want you. That\\'s where you start doing special things in the park,\" de Villiers said on his official YouTube channel.De Villiers said his former RCB teammate Siraj does not afraid of experimenting with the ball and he always tried to get the batters out.\"Siraj always keeps coming back, he\\'s always in your face. The bowlers who are respected most are those who never give up. They are always in your face, that\\'s what Siraj does.

       " \"In 2018, civic authorities in Mumbai conceived an ambitious bicycle track plan. The idea was to provide the city's commute and recreational cyclists with safe stretches.Five years on, Mumbai's cyclists say the project's execution has largely been a disappointment. The isolated and disjointed tracks have failed to meet their objective, they say.Commute cyclists have no use for the tracks as they often lead from nowhere to nowhere. In most cases, they do not provide critical connectivity to train and metro stations or even bus stands.Meanwhile, most recreational cyclists, who like going on long rides, avoid these tracks as they are not continuous and obstacle-free.At some locations, the cycle tracks have been taken over by parked taxis or bikers trying to get ahead in heavy traffic. At others, pedestrians walk on cycle tracks because the adjacent footpaths are not fit for use. As a result, cyclists are pushed onto the roads to deal with heavy motorized traffic. Even our bus and autorickshaw stands are on the left side of the road, and cause breaks in cycle tracks.Experts say pedestrian amenities must be improved to keep the cycle tracks free of pedestrians. Also, adding cycle tracks to existing roads may be difficult, but all new roads and bridges being planned should factor in space for cycle tracks. There are also some radical ideas like moving the cycle tracks from the left of the road to the medians in the middle of the roads, or pop-up tracks that can be set up at particular times.Moreover, change in mindset also has a big role to play. Cyclists complain that other motorists often see them as slow-moving nuisances, and feel the money invested in cycling infrastructure should instead be used to make pothole-free roads. This attitude must change for cyclists to feel safer on Mumbai's streets. What people do not realise is that no matter how many roads, bridges and motorways are built, they will never be enough for the increasing number of vehicles.

It is an amazing feeling, which I can\\'t explain. I have always wanted my first child to be a baby girl because I feel that they change the world for fathers. It is an inexplicable feeling.

A day before that, we had gone out for Ganpati darshan. When we came back at night, Disha had a lot of pain which went on for the entire night.

       " 'HANGZHOU: \\'Smart\\'. That\\'s what one comes across as a unanimous first impression at the 19th Asian Games, but it\\'s not a surprise when you are at what\\'s regarded as the Artificial Intelligence (AI) headquarters - Hangzhou. And, therefore, not a surprise to witness China promoting the 19th edition of the Asiad as the \\'Smart\\' Games.Hangzhou, in fact, brings together a unique blend of historical landscapes like the West Lake, which has inspired poets as long back as the 9th century and one that has seen it become a world leader in technology.Hangzhou\\'s role in the ancient Silk Road is a major part of its rich cultural heritage, which led to development of civilization that has gone to add that \\'silken\\' touch to its seamless technology-driven living in the modern era, and it is also driving the Games. From the bottom to the top level, the Games paint a picture that at times almost resembles a \\'Technology Fair\\' - at least until the on-field competition completely takes over after the opening ceremony on September 23. A walk through the Main Media Centre (MMC) can leave even the digital freaks overwhelmed. It\\'s literally a \\'Cloud\\' of technology and activity that mesmerizes you. A robot can answer all your banking queries at the Main Media Centre, another one can be seen exhibiting its ability to transfer small goods from one point to another. If you are in the way, it will gently say, \\'please be careful.\\'You can walk into the AI-generated image kiosk to punch keywords of your choice and ask the system to throw up related images that you can then cast on the giant digital curve, or take a walkthrough to learn how AI can revolutionize the broadcast world. Enter the MMC and a giant screen beaming a \\'Cloud\\' of activity across the Games welcomes the accredited media. At the venues, if you are unable to locate your seat, the \\'Smart Hangzhou 2022\\' application will do it for you.The Tonglu Equestrian Centre, intriguingly, has been provided a \\'digital twin\\'. It replicates the arena and uses technology to digitally keep an eye on all the aspects, including energy conservation.Language barriers seem a thing of the past when volunteers not fluent in English push a button on their cell phone and gently extend the device closer to a foreign guest to record his query. The AI-enabled application translates that into Mandarin for the volunteers, who then are ready to guide. \"Regarding intelligent spectator experiences, we have created the first-ever digital spectator service platform called \\'Smart Hangzhou 2022,\\' and introduced Asian Games AR services,\" said Chen Weiqiang, executive secretary-general of the Organizing Committee of the Games, at a press conference.But that\\'s not where it ends. The Games have also incorporated:1. 5G-Advanced: Can transfer data up to 10 times the speed of standard 5G2. Passive IoT (Internet of things): Can monitor environmental temperatures and humidity, tracking of logistics vehicles, warehouse management, asset inventory management and can prevent theft by monitoring valuable assets deployed at the Games venues3. Driverless buses: Uses autonomous driving technology (in service at the co-host city of Deqing, between the Sports Center Gymnasium and the Geographic Information Town Basketball Court) Not far in the future, the \\'China Artificial Intelligence Town\\' in Hangzhou will stand to testify the city\\'s leading presence on the world technology map.

This is a chance for him to play in this format and we just want to give him an opportunity to play in two or three games,\" Dravid said during the media conference.\"If we have a player like Ashwin, who we can rely upon if someone is injured, it\\'s a blessing for us. It\\'s a good chance for him to test himself because he has not played 50-over cricket for a long time,\" Dravid said about the bowler, who has 151 ODI wickets in 113 games but has played only two 50-over games for India in the past six years.In case Axar can\\'t make it, Ashwin will be an ideal candidate to bat at No. 8 with his years of experience.\"Someone like Ashwin provides you that experience, that ability to also contribute with the bat at No. 8. Someone we always thought of that in case, there are certain opportunities opened, he is someone, who is definitely a part of your plans,\" Dravid explained the rationale behind calling Ashwin to play this format after 19 months.In case of Suryakumar, the \\'Wall\\' was more or less bullish the team is fully backing the T20 stalwart to come good in a version where has an average of less than 25 in 27 ODIs.So, should Surya worry about September 27, the day India will announce its final 15 for the World Cup?\"I don\\'t think Surya needs to worry about the 27th. That\\'s not why we picked our team for the World Cup, and Surya is in it and we have made our decision to do that and we completely back it,\" said an assertive Dravid while backing the right-hander from Mumbai.\"We back him (Surya) because he has quality and ability that we have seen. Yes, we know, we have at the moment, seen it in T20 cricket but we know the kind of impact a player like him can make. He can change the course of a game and we completely back him, we are clear about that,\" Dravid added.The coach said Surya will play the first two games, if not all three and he is confident that he will come good.\"There is total clarity on the fact that we are completely behind him and hopefully he will be able to turn it around.\"Hopefully, he is someone who will get these three games and at least the first couple certainly to be able to develop and continue his journey as an ODI cricketer. But in terms of selection, we made our decision.\"It is also learnt that the fast-bowling unit will be rotated during the series to keep it fresh for the marquee event, something which has led the team management to rest both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.\"People like Virat and Rohit specifically, from our perspective, it\\'s really important to get them to that World Cup in a physical and mental space that they want to be in. They know how they need to prepare themselves and a lot of these decisions are made in discussions with them,\" he clarified.The team management does make exceptions for senior players, who have their own routines and know their body well.\"Senior and more experienced guys have their routines and know how they want to prepare in the lead-up to a big event like the World Cup.\"I think, based on those discussions, we come up with mutual decisions to just take off and refresh mentally more than anything else.

The wells also received a beautiful makeover as a part of the beautification works under the project.Traditionally, open wells have been the source of water for drinking and irrigation purposes in Virudhunagar, which is a semi-arid and rainfed district. However, over a period of time, the wells were abandoned due to lack of water. As many as 163 wells defunct and abandoned in various parts of the district were identified for the project.The works which were taken up by the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA), commenced during August and were completed by November 2022, using the funds under MGNREGA scheme and convergence of other local funds. The project was the initiative of the then Virudhunagar district collector J Meghanath Reddy. The methodology used to recharge is that earth around the wells were excavated to a width of 1.20 to 1.50 metres and to a depth of 0.75metres. Perforated horizontal and vertical pipes are laid around the wells in four directions to collect the surface water. These pipes are closed by end caps and are covered by wire mesh to prevent the entry of dirt and other dust particles.In an attempt to invite the attention of people and to create awareness on water conservation, water harvesting and recharging structures, the outer structure of the wells were beautified. The outer structure of the wells were redesigned to give an aesthetic appearance in various shapes such as a train compartments, cup and saucer, basket, gift box, watermelon, treasure box etc.An assistant engineer, DRDA, G Prakash Kumar said that the main objective of the project is to recharge and rejuvenate the abandoned wells to recharge the groundwater at the locality. The wells which were abandoned due to lack of water and were used for dumping garbage due to lack of water had now become recharge structures. The top portion of the wells were also closed using steel railings to prevent any mishaps. Steps are also taken to ensure that the rejuvenated wells are maintained properly. \"The wells for this project were strategically chosen based on their location. The wells situated near overhead water tanks and near water tanks were chosen so that the water overflowing from the tanks would drain into the wells for recharge. The wells situated in the low lying areas were also chosen for the rain water to automatically drain to the well through the pipelines,\" he explained.He said that the significant aspect of this project is the beautification works. The outer portion of the wells were designed in various shapes such as train compartments, baskets, drums, coffee cups. The beautification works would help to create awareness among the public about the need for conservation of open wells, he added.The president of the Muthuramalingapuram village panchayat in Aruppukottai taluk, S Boominathan said that a well was in existence for the past 40 years. Due to lack of water the well was abandoned for the past over 25 years. However, the well presently acts as a groundwater recharge structure because it was taken up for rejuvenation and beautification under this project. He said that the well is situated close to an overhead water tank at Narthampatti village which comes under the Muthuramalingapuram village panchayat. Pipelines have been laid to drain the water overflowing from the tank inside the well. \"During the rainy season, rain water also drains inside the well. This project has not only turned an abandoned well into a recharge structure but it prevents any rain water stagnation at the area around the well,\" he noted.\"The well at our village has been redesigned in the shape of a basket and painted with attractive colours. It has become a place of attraction now. People who once did not know that such a well was in existence, look at the well with surprise now. It has also become a public space for children to play around since the well has now become safe with its top portion covered\", said Boominathan.\"I have never seen water in the well which is situated in our village for over 30 years. After this project was undertaken last year, I am happy to see water percolation inside the well for the very first time,\" said G Manoharan, president of the Pannaimoondradaippu village panchayat at Tiruchuli taluk.He said that the well in the village was just a small one which is only 30 feet in depth. It was defunct due to lack of water. \"After the well was rejuvenated under the project, the village received good rainfall during the monsoon season, last year. Since arrangements were made for rain water to drain into the well, water percolation is seen inside the well. With periodical maintenance, the well would be helpful in the years to come for groundwater recharge,\" he said.Manoharan said that the well situated in the village has been redesigned in the shape of train compartments on all four sides. \"This well has now become an identity of our village. People, especially children, became joyful when they saw the well in the shape of a train compartment. After the well was redesigned, whenever people saw me they used to ask me with a smile, \\'Thalaivare, rail engae pogudhu\\' (President, where is the train going)\", he added.',\n",

       " \"COVID has a long-lasting impact on the human health. Scientists and health experts have been analyzing the impact of COVID on human beings and this has led to raising awareness around long COVID. Currently, BA.2.86 and EG.5 variants of COVID are in circulation. These variants are the sub-variants of the Omicron variant of COVID and are said to have a higher transmission rate than their ancestors. While most people infected with COVID-19 have milder symptoms and recover within a few weeks, the global pandemic produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to pose a substantial health risk. Some of the individuals affected may develop more severe sickness and pneumonia, often resulting in a more unfavourable prognosis.Although protocols have been developed to assess patients' risk, diagnostic and prognostic tools primarily rely on expensive and less accessible imaging methods, such as radiography, ultrasound, or computed tomography (CT). Therefore, there is a need to develop a simpler and more readily available prognostic tool that enables healthcare providers to identify patients who have developed or are at risk of developing severe disease. This would streamline patient triage and facilitate early intervention, even in home or primary care settings. Now, a research team led by IBEC and Hospital del Mar, with collaboration from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), CIBER-BBN and CIBERES, has carried out a study based on the analysis and interpretation of cough sounds in the initial phases of COVID-19. This method is presented as a potential predictive, simple, and accessible tool to assess the risk of suffering severe pneumonia. The research involved smartphone recordings of voluntary coughing sounds from 70 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, all recorded within the first 24 hours after their admission to the hospital. IBEC conducted an acoustic analysis of these recordings, which revealed significant differences in cough sounds depending on the severity of the respiratory condition, as previously confirmed by imaging tests and the need for supplemental oxygen.The results indicate that this analysis could be used to categorize COVID-19 patients as mild, moderate, or severe and to monitor patients with persistent COVID-19. The study was conducted using data collected between April 2020 and May 2021 at Hospital del Mar, and the findings have been published in the European Respiratory Journal Open Research.\",\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON: Justin Trudeau\\'s efforts to put India in the dock -- ostensibly for domestic political survival -- for the unsolved murder of a Khalistani radical is backfiring spectacularly with growing global and national scrutiny of Canada\\'s harboring of extremists on the run from India. While the episode is also drawing attention to the Modi government\\'s hardline approach to national security and its treatment of minorities in India, Trudeau\\'s domestic standing and the reputation of his government, which survives on support from a pro-Khalistan Sikh leader, is taking a beating. The Canadian Prime Minister spent much of Wednesday canvassing support at the United Nations for his sketchy allegation that New Delhi engineered the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar -- a terrorist fugitive from India who emigrated to Canada -- with little to show for it. Canadian officials said he met leaders of Kenya, Chile, Italy, Germany and the European Union and apprised them of the spat with India among other matters. But readouts from Trudeau\\'s office about the meetings made no mention of the issue, and none of the countries involved made any mention of the hot-button issue between Canada and India. Instead, sections of the Canadian media zeroed in on the sketchy language of Trudeau\\'s accusation against New Delhi (\"credible allegations\" and \"potential\" links among other hedge language), suggesting he had jumped the gun in his eagerness to use the issue to shore up his political standing amid tanking poll numbers. \"It’s important to remember Trudeau’s accusation has yet to be proven....(he has) so far failed to provide any evidence to Canadians,\" the National Post said in an editorial, pointing to \"his use of vague language and lack of any specific intelligence.\"\"If it turns out that Trudeau dropped this metaphorical bomb without having all his ducks in order, it will be a huge scandal, with massive domestic and geopolitical ramifications,\" it added. A recent poll by the Angus Reid Institute cited by the Canadian media showed Trudeau now has an approval rating of just 33 per cent, against a disapproval rating of 63 per cent. His Liberal government survives on support from the 24-member New Democratic Party, whose leader Jagmeet Singh is said to be sympathetic to the Khalistan cause. Meanwhile, there is also renewed scrutiny of the slain extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, whose deification as a saint is undermined by videos on social media showing him training with assault weapons and celebrating the assassination of Indian political leaders and an army general. Disquiet about Trudeau\\'s coddling of the Khalistani constituency is also riffling through his Liberal Party, particularly after Nijjar\\'s lawyer, separatist gadabout Gurpatwant Pannu, warned Canadian Hindus to go back to India in a toxic hate video.Accusing Pannu, a US-based Sikh extremist, of trying to provoke Hindu-Canadians and dividing Hindu and Sikh communities in Canada, Chandra Arya, an MP from Trudeau\\'s Liberal Party, pointed out that \"vast majority of our Canadian Sikh brothers and sisters do not support Khalistan movement.\"\"Most Sikh Canadians may not publicly condemn the Khalistan movement for several reasons but they are deeply connected to the Hindu-Canadian community. Canadian Hindus and Sikhs are connected through family relationships and shared social and cultural ties,\" he said. In an implicit condemnation of his own party leader and government, Arya tweeted, \"I can’t understand how glorification of terrorism or a hate crime targeting a religious group is allowed in the name of freedom of speech and expression. There would be an outrage in Canada if a white supremist attacked any group of racialized Canadians asking them to get out of our country.

       " 'NEW DELHI: A woman who is already married to someone else cannot claim to have been induced into a sexual relationship under false pretext of marriage, the Delhi High Court has said while quashing a rape case against a man, also married, by his live-in partner. Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma, in an order released on Thursday, noted the case involved two individuals who were both ineligible to lawfully marry each other but were living together pursuant to a \"live-in relationship agreement\", and the protection and remedies available under Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the Indian Penal Code cannot be extended to such a \"victim\". The judge observed that live-in relationship between two consenting adults, who are married to different partners, has not been made a criminal offence, and while the parties have the right to determine their own choices, both men and women should \"remain conscious of the repercussion\" of such a relationship. \"Once the complainant/respondent no. 2 herself was not legally divorced and is not so till date, the petitioner could not have married her as per law. It was also not mentioned in the agreement that they were living in or maintaining relationship with each other due to a promise of marriage by the petitioner/accused,\" the court stated. \"When the victim herself is not legally eligible to marry someone else due to her existing marriage to another partner, she cannot claim to have been induced into a sexual relationship under false pretext of marriage. Thus, the protection and remedies available under Section 376 of the IPC cannot be extended to a victim who was not legally entitled to marry the person whom she was in sexual relationship with,\" added the court. In the instant case, the petitioner accused sought quashing of the FIR for alleged rape. He cited several grounds including that the complainant\\'s conduct itself was against public policy and norms of society. In the order, Justice Sharma deprecated the use of \"derogatory\" remarks made by the accused against the complainant and called out his \"misogynistic thinking\". The court said the same standards applied to the male partner and judges cannot pass moral judgments based on one\\'s gender. \"This Court is of the opinion that although the immorality of the act on the part of the female partner was argued at length before this Court, the same standard applies to the male partner, and no distinction should be made based on gender, as doing so would perpetuate misogynistic thinking,\" the court said. It said courts cannot \"serve as legal moralists preaching morality\" or \"inject morality into existing laws\" and no offence can be said to be committed if sexual relations are established between two adults willingly, irrespective of their marital status. \"In many cases of live-in relationships both the parties may be unmarried or either of them may be married or both may be married to their respective spouses,\" the court said. \"Individual adults are free to make decisions even those that might not align with societal norms or expectations, however, in those cases they have to remain ready to face potential consequences of such relationships. Needless to say, individual free choices like these will invite individual responsibilities and consequences,\" it added.(With PTI inputs)',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: An unusually assertive head coach Rahul Dravid emphasised that a cricketer of Ravichandran Ashwin\\'s caliber should not be subjected to a \"trial.\"Conversely, someone with the remarkable talents of Suryakumar Yadav need not fret about securing his place in the World Cup squad. Dravid made these remarks on the eve of the three-match ODI series against Australia in Mohali.Ashwin has been included in the squad, along with Washington Sundar, as a potential replacement for Axar Patel in case the spin-bowling all-rounder is unable to recover from his quadricep tear.While this ODI series has been framed as a competition between Ashwin and Washington, Dravid refrains from using the term \"trial\" for a cricketer of Ashwin\\'s extensive experience and reputation.\"I will not say that for him it is a trial or anything (for Ashwin), we know his quality. This is a chance for him to play in this format and we just want to give him an opportunity to play in two or three games,\" Dravid said during the media conference.\"If we have a player like Ashwin, who we can rely upon if someone is injured, it\\'s a blessing for us. It\\'s a good chance for him to test himself because he has not played 50-over cricket for a long time,\" Dravid said about the bowler, who has 151 ODI wickets in 113 games but has played only two 50-over games for India in the past six years.In case Axar can\\'t make it, Ashwin will be an ideal candidate to bat at No. 8 with his years of experience.\"Someone like Ashwin provides you that experience, that ability to also contribute with the bat at No. 8. Someone we always thought of that in case, there are certain opportunities opened, he is someone, who is definitely a part of your plans,\" Dravid explained the rationale behind calling Ashwin to play this format after 19 months.In case of Suryakumar, the \\'Wall\\' was more or less bullish the team is fully backing the T20 stalwart to come good in a version where has an average of less than 25 in 27 ODIs.So, should Surya worry about September 27, the day India will announce its final 15 for the World Cup?\"I don\\'t think Surya needs to worry about the 27th. That\\'s not why we picked our team for the World Cup, and Surya is in it and we have made our decision to do that and we completely back it,\" said an assertive Dravid while backing the right-hander from Mumbai.\"We back him (Surya) because he has quality and ability that we have seen. Yes, we know, we have at the moment, seen it in T20 cricket but we know the kind of impact a player like him can make. He can change the course of a game and we completely back him, we are clear about that,\" Dravid added.The coach said Surya will play the first two games, if not all three and he is confident that he will come good.\"There is total clarity on the fact that we are completely behind him and hopefully he will be able to turn it around.\"Hopefully, he is someone who will get these three games and at least the first couple certainly to be able to develop and continue his journey as an ODI cricketer. But in terms of selection, we made our decision.\"It is also learnt that the fast-bowling unit will be rotated during the series to keep it fresh for the marquee event, something which has led the team management to rest both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.\"People like Virat and Rohit specifically, from our perspective, it\\'s really important to get them to that World Cup in a physical and mental space that they want to be in. They know how they need to prepare themselves and a lot of these decisions are made in discussions with them,\" he clarified.The team management does make exceptions for senior players, who have their own routines and know their body well.\"Senior and more experienced guys have their routines and know how they want to prepare in the lead-up to a big event like the World Cup.\"I think, based on those discussions, we come up with mutual decisions to just take off and refresh mentally more than anything else.

       " 'NEW DELHI: Delhi lieutenant governor V K Saxena inaugurated a groundbreaking online portal on Thursday, allowing individuals to report instances of corruption involving government employees, according to officials at Raj Niwas. The new platform, called the Vigilance Complaint Information Management System (VCIMS), is the first of its kind in India. It aims to expedite the handling of corruption complaints while ensuring transparency and confidentiality.During the launch, LG Saxena emphasized that VCIMS would function as a centralized portal, enabling citizens to file vigilance complaints against employees of various Delhi government departments, including MCD, NDMC, DDA, and Delhi Police. The system also aims to discourage frivolous complaints and attempts at blackmail.Saxena stated, \"I hope that this first-of-its-kind initiative in the country will prove to be an effective tool to achieve the goal of zero tolerance to corruption by ensuring faceless interface between the government and the general public, who avails government services.\"Officials clarified that physical complaints related to corruption would not be accepted or acted upon, as VCIMS offers a simplified and efficient method for lodging such complaints online. This system will facilitate quicker processing and timely action against corrupt government officials.Importantly, VCIMS ensures the confidentiality of the complainant\\'s identity, which may only be disclosed in exceptional circumstances with the approval of the competent authority. The portal is expected to act as a significant deterrent, reducing opportunities for manipulation and managing complainants. It will also enhance complainants\\' awareness of their legal liability for making false, frivolous, or vexatious complaints, potentially leading to prosecution under section 182 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).To maintain the authenticity of complaints, individuals must complete a one-time registration on the platform, using their mobile number along with either Aadhaar, PAN, or Election ID number. Complainants will receive updates on their complaint\\'s status via SMS on their registered mobile number.Before the portal\\'s launch, two training sessions were conducted for the heads of various Delhi government departments.

       " 'WASHINGTON: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy makes his second wartime visit to Washington on Thursday in a bid to win fresh aid to fight Russian invaders despite signs of war fatigue among US lawmakers.Zelenskyy will travel to the White House for talks with President Joe Biden and go to the Pentagon to seek more weapons including longer-range missiles to boost Ukraine\\'s forces.But his most crucial date is likely to be with leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties from the US Congress, where a new multibillion-dollar aid package for Kyiv is at risk of being blocked.The White House said the Ukrainian leader\\'s visit came at a \"really critical time\" as Ukraine\\'s slow-moving counteroffensive against Russian forces grinds forward into fall.Zelenskyy will arrive fresh from the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where he urged the world to stand firm with Ukraine against Russia\\'s \"genocide.\"He asked Americans to keep up their support which has seen Washington pump more than $43 billion in military aid to Ukraine since Russia\\'s February 2022 invasion.\"We are on the finishing line,\" he told CNN on Tuesday.\\'Brutalize Ukraine\\' But Zelenskyy\\'s trip to Washington will be very different from his first wartime visit in December 2022, when he secretly flew in and received a hero\\'s welcome at the White House and on Capitol Hill.This time doubts are growing over the future of US assistance, with hardline Republicans saying they won\\'t approve funding to prevent a US government shutdown if it includes aid for Ukraine.Biden has pledged to stand by Kyiv no matter what -- not least as his 2024 reelection campaign portrays his support for Ukraine as demonstrating his global leadership.The US president and First Lady Jill Biden will greet Zelenskyy and his wife Olena Zelenska at the White House, before the two leaders have head-to-head talks in the Oval Office, according to US officials.Biden is \"looking forward to getting a battlefield perspective directly from Ukraine\\'s commander in chief,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.Zelenskyy\\'s reported request for longer-range ATACMS missiles that can strike up to 300 kilometers (190 miles) away is \"not off the table\" but there has been no decision yet, Kirby added.\"The president will be talking to President Zelenskyy about his needs and about how the United States will continue to meet those needs.\"Biden, speaking Tuesday at the UN, warned against abandoning Ukraine, saying that \"Russia believes that the world will grow weary and allow it to brutalize Ukraine without consequence.\"His warning came a day before Poland said it would no longer arm Ukraine in a mounting row over grain exports.What\\'s the plan?Zelenskyy also faces the delicate task of wooing Congress, where Ukraine\\'s hopes are hostage to the drama over a looming government shutdown.Hard-right Republican lawmakers are holding up the White House\\'s demand for any budget bill passed by Congress to include a further $24 billion in military and humanitarian aid for Kyiv.But even more moderate Republicans have their doubts.\"What\\'s the plan for victory? I think that\\'s what the American public wants to know,\" Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said this week.Some say the money could be better spent on US border security, while there are also concerns about the pace of Kyiv\\'s counteroffensive and that corruption in Ukraine means the money will go to waste.Former president Donald Trump, the frontrunner to challenge Biden next year, has said the money would be better spent at home and predicted an eventual triumph for Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom he has shown admiration.',\n",
       " 'YAMUNANAGAR: The police have registered a case of murder and dowry death against five persons of a family, after a woman, daughter of a Haryana police officer, died allegedly after consuming poisonous substance in Yamunanagar district on Wednesday.The deceased was identified as Navdeep Kaur (26), who was married to Kapil of Sandhai village in Bilaspur sub-division.On the complaint of Navdeep’s mother, Ranjit Kaur, a case under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 302 (murder) and 304-B (dowry death) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered against Kapil, his mother Gurmeet Kaur, father Nirmal Singh, and their relatives Chand Ram and Dharambir Singh at Bilaspur police station on Thursday.Ranjit told the police that their daughter Navdeep was married to Kapil on November 28, 2021 and soon after, her in-laws started harassing and torturing her for dowry.“In dowry, we gave the base model of a car to our daughter but they started demanding a top model at that time only. We gave gold to Kapil, his parents and other relatives as per their demand and beyond our capability. Navdeep’s in-laws kept harassing her for more dowry and recently, Kapil was demanding a motorcycle. After continuous complaints from Navdeep, my husband went to the house of Navdeep’s in-laws on September 12, 2023, and came back after convincing my daughter’s in-laws”, said Ranjit.She said on Wednesday evening, we received the information that Navdeep was admitted at a private hospital in Yamunanagar.“We reached the hospital, where we met Kapil, who told us that Navdeep consumed some poisonous substance. At about 6.30pm, the doctor told us that Navdeep died. Kapil and his relatives fled from the hospital. Either my daughter consumed poisonous substance due to dowry harassment caused by her in-laws or she has been murdered by her in-laws and relatives in connivance as their demand was not fulfilled”, alleged Ranjit Kaur.Bilaspur police station house officer (SHO) sub-inspector Gian Chand said, “So far, no arrest has been made in this case. The post-mortem of the deceased was conducted and the body was handed over to family members for last rites. Investigation is being done.\"',\n",

       " \"COVID has a long-lasting impact on the human health. Scientists and health experts have been analyzing the impact of COVID on human beings and this has led to raising awareness around long COVID. Currently, BA.2.86 and EG.5 variants of COVID are in circulation. These variants are the sub-variants of the Omicron variant of COVID and are said to have a higher transmission rate than their ancestors. While most people infected with COVID-19 have milder symptoms and recover within a few weeks, the global pandemic produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to pose a substantial health risk. Some of the individuals affected may develop more severe sickness and pneumonia, often resulting in a more unfavourable prognosis.Although protocols have been developed to assess patients' risk, diagnostic and prognostic tools primarily rely on expensive and less accessible imaging methods, such as radiography, ultrasound, or computed tomography (CT). Therefore, there is a need to develop a simpler and more readily available prognostic tool that enables healthcare providers to identify patients who have developed or are at risk of developing severe disease. This would streamline patient triage and facilitate early intervention, even in home or primary care settings. Now, a research team led by IBEC and Hospital del Mar, with collaboration from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), CIBER-BBN and CIBERES, has carried out a study based on the analysis and interpretation of cough sounds in the initial phases of COVID-19. This method is presented as a potential predictive, simple, and accessible tool to assess the risk of suffering severe pneumonia. The research involved smartphone recordings of voluntary coughing sounds from 70 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, all recorded within the first 24 hours after their admission to the hospital. IBEC conducted an acoustic analysis of these recordings, which revealed significant differences in cough sounds depending on the severity of the respiratory condition, as previously confirmed by imaging tests and the need for supplemental oxygen.The results indicate that this analysis could be used to categorize COVID-19 patients as mild, moderate, or severe and to monitor patients with persistent COVID-19. The study was conducted using data collected between April 2020 and May 2021 at Hospital del Mar, and the findings have been published in the European Respiratory Journal Open Research.\",\n",

       " 'VIRUDHUNAGAR: A novel water conservation project launched by the Virudhunagar district administration officials called \\'String of Wells\\', paved the way for rejuvenation and recharge of as many as 163 defunct and abandoned open wells in the district. The wells also received a beautiful makeover as a part of the beautification works under the project.Traditionally, open wells have been the source of water for drinking and irrigation purposes in Virudhunagar, which is a semi-arid and rainfed district. However, over a period of time, the wells were abandoned due to lack of water. As many as 163 wells defunct and abandoned in various parts of the district were identified for the project.The works which were taken up by the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA), commenced during August and were completed by November 2022, using the funds under MGNREGA scheme and convergence of other local funds. The project was the initiative of the then Virudhunagar district collector J Meghanath Reddy. The methodology used to recharge is that earth around the wells were excavated to a width of 1.20 to 1.50 metres and to a depth of 0.75metres. Perforated horizontal and vertical pipes are laid around the wells in four directions to collect the surface water. These pipes are closed by end caps and are covered by wire mesh to prevent the entry of dirt and other dust particles.In an attempt to invite the attention of people and to create awareness on water conservation, water harvesting and recharging structures, the outer structure of the wells were beautified. The outer structure of the wells were redesigned to give an aesthetic appearance in various shapes such as a train compartments, cup and saucer, basket, gift box, watermelon, treasure box etc.An assistant engineer, DRDA, G Prakash Kumar said that the main objective of the project is to recharge and rejuvenate the abandoned wells to recharge the groundwater at the locality. The wells which were abandoned due to lack of water and were used for dumping garbage due to lack of water had now become recharge structures. The top portion of the wells were also closed using steel railings to prevent any mishaps. Steps are also taken to ensure that the rejuvenated wells are maintained properly. \"The wells for this project were strategically chosen based on their location. The wells situated near overhead water tanks and near water tanks were chosen so that the water overflowing from the tanks would drain into the wells for recharge. The wells situated in the low lying areas were also chosen for the rain water to automatically drain to the well through the pipelines,\" he explained.He said that the significant aspect of this project is the beautification works. The outer portion of the wells were designed in various shapes such as train compartments, baskets, drums, coffee cups. The beautification works would help to create awareness among the public about the need for conservation of open wells, he added.The president of the Muthuramalingapuram village panchayat in Aruppukottai taluk, S Boominathan said that a well was in existence for the past 40 years. Due to lack of water the well was abandoned for the past over 25 years. However, the well presently acts as a groundwater recharge structure because it was taken up for rejuvenation and beautification under this project. He said that the well is situated close to an overhead water tank at Narthampatti village which comes under the Muthuramalingapuram village panchayat. Pipelines have been laid to drain the water overflowing from the tank inside the well. \"During the rainy season, rain water also drains inside the well. This project has not only turned an abandoned well into a recharge structure but it prevents any rain water stagnation at the area around the well,\" he noted.\"The well at our village has been redesigned in the shape of a basket and painted with attractive colours. It has become a place of attraction now. People who once did not know that such a well was in existence, look at the well with surprise now. It has also become a public space for children to play around since the well has now become safe with its top portion covered\", said Boominathan.\"I have never seen water in the well which is situated in our village for over 30 years. After this project was undertaken last year, I am happy to see water percolation inside the well for the very first time,\" said G Manoharan, president of the Pannaimoondradaippu village panchayat at Tiruchuli taluk.He said that the well in the village was just a small one which is only 30 feet in depth. It was defunct due to lack of water. \"After the well was rejuvenated under the project, the village received good rainfall during the monsoon season, last year. Since arrangements were made for rain water to drain into the well, water percolation is seen inside the well. With periodical maintenance, the well would be helpful in the years to come for groundwater recharge,\" he said.Manoharan said that the well situated in the village has been redesigned in the shape of train compartments on all four sides. \"This well has now become an identity of our village. People, especially children, became joyful when they saw the well in the shape of a train compartment.

Please report any incident of Hinduphobia to your local law enforcement agencies,\" he added.He further said that the Khalistan movement leader is trying to \"provoke\" the Hindu Canadians to react and \"divide the Hindu and Sikh communities\" in Canada.However, Arya also clarified that a majority of Canadian Sikhs do not support the Khalistan movement.\"Let me be clear. Vast majority of our Canadian Sikh brothers and sisters do not support the Khalistan movement. Most Sikh Canadians may not publicly condemn the Khalistan movement for several reasons but they are deeply connected to the Hindu-Canadian community. Canadian Hindus and Sikhs are connected through family relationships and shared social and cultural ties,\" he further said.Arya stated that this \"direct attack\" on Hindu Canadians by the leader of the Canadian Khalistan movement is the further escalation of the recent attacks on Hindu temples and public celebration of the assassination of Hindu Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by \"terrorists\".\"Canada has high moral values and we fully uphold the rule of law,\" he added.He further expressed dismay at \"glorification of terrorism\" and hate crime being allowed in the name of \"freedom of expression\".\"I can\\'t understand how the glorification of terrorism or a hate crime targeting a religious group is allowed in the name of freedom of speech and expression. There would be an outrage in Canada if a white supremacist attacked any group of racialized Canadians asking them to get out of our country. But apparently, this Khalistleader can get away with this hate crime,\" he said.Arya added that the Hindu Canadians keep a low profile, are considered soft targets, and the \"anti-Hindu elements\" cannot digest the success of Hindu-Canadians.\"Two well-organized groups claiming to represent their faiths have been attacking Hindu-Canadian community leaders, Hindu organizations and even me. For over ten months, I have been attacked for raising a flag with our Hindu religious sacred symbol Aum on our parliament hill,\" he stated.Arya further called upon Hindu-Canadians to stay calm but vigilant.\"As Canadians, we can be proud of our Hindu faith and heritage and our impressive contribution to the socio-economic success of our country Canada,\" he added.Earlier on Monday, in a further souring of ties, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau alleged India\\'s involvement in the killing of Hardeep Nijjar a designated terrorist in India. This was followed by Canada expelling an Indian diplomat from the country.India has outrightly rejected the allegations, dubbing it as \"absurd\" and \"motivated\". In a reciprocal move India then expelled a senior Canadian diplomat from the country.Khalistan Tiger Force chief Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a designated terrorist in India, was gunned down outside a Gurdwara, in a parking area in Canada\\'s Surrey, British Columbia on June 18.',\n",
       " \"India's manufacturing success in the global arena over the past five years has been notable and it has emerged as a winner, as per a study by BCG, quoted in an ET report. During this period, Indian exports to the US surged by $23 billion, marking a 44% increase from 2018 to 2022. In contrast, China experienced a 10% drop in its exports to the US.The study, titled 'Harnessing the Tectonic Shifts in Global Manufacturing,' sheds light on the transformation in manufacturing and sourcing across various industries. This shift has been triggered by factors such as trade disputes, the pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain disruptions. In response, global companies have had to reconsider their manufacturing and sourcing strategies, with India emerging as a favored destination.The study highlights India's advantage in direct manufacturing costs as an export platform. According to BCG's calculations, the average cost of Indian-made goods imported into the US, factoring in factory wages, productivity, logistics, tariffs, and energy, is 15% lower compared to goods manufactured in the US. In contrast, Chinese goods offer only a 4% cost advantage over US-made products and are 21% more expensive when subject to US tariffs related to the trade war. Specifically, semiconductor and material shipments from India to the US saw a remarkable 143% increase over the past five years, though starting from a modest base. Meanwhile, China's exports in these categories decreased by 29%. Furthermore, Indian exports of auto components to the US rose by 65%, and mechanical machinery exports grew by 70%.Ravi Srivastava, the global leader of BCG's operations practice said that for the past two decades, there has been talk of India's potential in manufacturing, often with a lingering question mark. Now, it seems that many pieces of the puzzle are falling into place. What sets this study apart is its comprehensive perspective, not only delving into the reconfiguration of global supply chains but also providing validation to the growing narrative of India as a manufacturing hub, he said. Looking forward, BCG sees potential for India to further enhance its role as a strategic manufacturing and sourcing destination. However, the decision to incorporate India into firms' strategies depends on a complex mix of factors, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution, it says.\",\n",

Earlier, it had planned to open both the stretches - Byappanahalli to KR Pura and Kengeri to Challaghatta - together, facilitating operations on the entire corridor of the line from Challaghatta to Kadugodi (Whitefield) for a length of 43km.Now, BMRCL is contemplating opening the KR Pura-Byappanahalli stretch first. As per the revised schedule, the commissioner of Metro railway safety (CMRS) is slated to hold a safety inspection on this stretch on September 21. For the other line, the schedule is yet to be fixed. A likely delay in getting safety clearance for Kengeri-Challaghatta line is forcing BMRCL to revisit its earlier decision. \"We are contemplating opening KR PuraByappanahalli line as and when we get safety clearance from the statutory authority. The reason is there is a lot of demand to link the Whitefield line that has been operational since March,\" an official said.The official said only after September 25, they will get more clarity on when the safety inspection for Kengeri-Challaghatta line will be scheduled. Asked about plans for inauguration, the official said, \"After receiving the safety clearance, it will be communicated to the higher-ups in the government. Are we going to inaugurate before September or early October? It\\'s difficult to say anything at this point.\" Opening of Byappanahalli-KR Pura stretch will provide seamless connectivity to the tech corridor of Whitefield.

His minister son Tej Pratap Yadav is also seen in a very happy mood, sitting close to his father.\"Lalu has been befooling the masses for long by adopting such tricks. He must know that the state has moved ahead and none is going to fall in his traps,\" former minister and HAM(S) president Santosh Kumar Suman said on Thursday.He said such events were quite usual while Lalu remained on the throne in his early 90’s and he just wants to remind the masses again. \"During that time, such dances were quite usual, and the (RJD) people would move on the streets carrying lathis in hands which made the masses lock themselves in homes,\" Suman said, asking the masses to be alert.The RJD denied it was a dance, adding this was a programme organised in memory of Bhikhari Thakur, a Bhojpuri language poet, playwright, lyricist, actor, folk dancer, folk singer and social activist. \"This was not a dance but a presentation of the popular folk dance,\" RJD spokesperson Shakti Singh Yadav said, adding the initiative was aimed at \"promoting the dying folk dance.\"Of late, Lalu has been caught indulging in activities other than politics. Last week, he was seen visiting a restaurant in Patna and enjoying Rajasthani food in the company of his elder son Tej Pratap. Prior to that he was seen taking rounds of Patna streets on his Rath in the company of his party colleague Shivanand Tiwari and then enjoying kulfi at Patna’s very own Marine Drive.

If these volunteers are detained, who will safeguard the Meitei villages in the vicinity of the hills and the valley from Kuki Zo militants.\"Similar endeavors to enter the Mayang Imphal police station in Imphal West district and the Andro police station in Imphal East district were also reported.In light of the apprehension of five individuals, including a suspected member of a proscribed terrorist group, on charges of extortion in Manipur, the Manipur Police has once again cautioned that stringent action will be taken against anyone exploiting their uniform for personal motives.According to officials, the five individuals were purportedly involved in extorting money from the general public and were found in possession of lethal weapons, including AK and Insas rifles, which were allegedly stolen from the police arsenal.(With agency inputs)',\n",

       " \"Lohum, producer of lithium-ion battery materials through recycling and repurposing in India, has signed a partnership agreement with Nepal, to deliver 25,000 metric tonnes of EV battery materials by 2028. Nepal is currently in the process of finding solutions to upscale its clean energy capacity across the board. Chinese battery material imports currently dominate the Nepal market, however, the solution that its new partnership with Lohum presents, will help it to increase its clean energy without sacrificing on its sovereignty, economy or natural resources. Under the guidelines of the partnership, Lohum will recycle and repurpose an estimated 200,000 batteries in Nepal and extract re-usable EV battery material such as lithium, nickel and cobalt to the tune of 25,000 metric tonnes. This will happen over a period of 5 years with an aim to make Nepal energy-abundant and self-sustaining. Nepal’s objective is to take a foundational step towards diversifying its sources of clean energy and move away from its dependence on Chinese materials. The move is also aligned with India's commitment towards affordable and inclusive energy for all nations worldwide and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The partnership with Lohum will further help Nepal’s EV ecosystem and its stakeholders to become compliant with the country’s Aarthik Vidheyak policy for management of end-of-life battery waste, introduced by the Government of Nepal in FY 2023. Moreover, the recycled materials will then recirculate in Nepal’s battery ecosystem indefinitely. In terms of Nepal and its EV ecosystem, major EV manufacturers such as Tata Motors, Citroen and MG are currently selling battery electric vehicles in the neighbouring country. The pool of BEVs in Nepal is projected to grow with incoming models from other major OEMS such as Volkswagen, Suzuki, Renault, and Mahindra Electric. Once, batteries from these cars enter the ecosystem then recycling and repurposing technologies like that of Lohumi, will further help Nepal become clean energy independent.\",\n",

Virat, who for years carried the dual responsibilities of captaincy and batting, has undergone significant changes in his batting approach recently. He\\'s become more daring, taking calculated risks and his hunger for big runs is also back.One unforgettable moment in this post-captaincy phase was his iconic innings against Pakistan in the T20 World Cup, where he played a stunning unbeaten knock of 82* off 53 balls, one of the finest performances of his career. Virat\\'s love affair with Pakistan continued in the recent Asia Cup too as he notched up his 47th ODI century against the Green Shirts, leaving him just three hundreds shy of breaking legendary Sachin Tendulkar\\'s record of 49 ODI tons. So, is Virat batting more freely now, and has relinquishing captaincy allowed him to become a much more focused batter?According to India\\'s senior spinner Amit Mishra, giving up the captaincy was a blessing for Virat.\"He is playing freely. Since he has quit his captaincy and Rohit became the captain, Virat is playing freely. He is now focussing and concentrating on his batting. With this, there is a lot of improvement in his batting,” Mishra, who is a cricket expert for JioCinema, told Timesofindia.com in an interview. \"When you are a captain, you have to focus on both aspects - your team and your batting. Now Virat is no longer a captain and his sole focus is on his batting. Since he left the captaincy, his batting has improved. He is the same Virat we saw a few years back [before the lean phase]. He is giving the same glimpse,\" Mishra said.

Virat gave up Test captaincy less than 24 hours after India lost a series in South Africa in January 2022.\"Virat is enjoying his batting, scoring runs, always smiling, having fun on the field, and speaking to other team members.

And the huge commercial success got me so much love. It even got me a National Award. I was being called the female hero and all that. Basically, I was not being Vidya. I was Silk. I was playing a character, and I was okay with it. I am far more comfortable being a character than being myself in public. When I am promoting the film, I have fun because I am promoting a character. The moment you make it about me, it makes me a little uncomfortable. So I had just done it without thinking. That translated to me being sexy. And I hadn’t been called sexy until then. Suddenly, there was a new me.” Recalling how she has embraced her body type, Vidya added, “I had also met Siddharth at that time. He made me feel great. I started accepting my body because of a combination of factors. But the journey had its ups and downs.

While many actors chose to have grand celebrations, actor couple Rohit Roy and Manasi Joshi Roy opted for a quiet celebration, spending time with Bappa alone.Rohit, who also posted a picture of his eco-friendly Ganpati on his social media, said, \"While everyone has their perception of celebrating Ganesh festival, this year I wanted it to be different. The entire Ganesh Chaturthi festivities were initiated by Lokmanya Tilak because he wanted people to come together at pandals and celebrate the festival. But over the years, I feel that the entire idea or meaning of getting Bappa home and celebrating the festival is getting lost somewhere. After 2015, I wasn\\'t getting Bappa home. I had many thoughts in my mind of how I wanted to celebrate the festival. Last year Jackie Shroff had got Bappa home and was sitting quietly with him. He had posted a picture of him on his social media and somehow I connected with it. There were no people around him, it was just him celebrating with Ganesha. I also had similar thoughts in mind and coincidentally Manasi also wanted to celebrate Ganesh festival quietly without any socialising. And so this year, we finally got an eco-friendly Ganesh home and I have not invited anyone. I wanted to meditate, spend time with my Gannuji, offer prasad and enjoy my celebration quietly without any pomp and noise. I told my friends that they are free to come, but I am not inviting anyone.\"Rohit added, \"I am not against people celebrating and getting together at each other\\'s homes. Even my brother and actor Rohit gets Bappa home and all our relatives and friends get together. My mother is also mostly there because she has to welcome her friends. This year, I wanted to keep it simple, quiet and wanted my time to reflect on my life and spend my time with God. I would like to reiterate that pandal hopping and socialising is not bad, but I am enjoying this quiet celebration with my wife at home. Ronit also visited some time back and my wife is shooting for her show. So I am spending my alone time with Ganeshji at home.\"The actor also shared how there are many festivals after this in the coming months to socialise. He said, \"After Ganeshji\\'s festival, there\\'s Navratri, Diwali, Durga Puja and we will get ample opportunities to socialise and meet people.

       " \"It is undeniable that iPhones are cheaper abroad. However, does it make sense to buy all iPhone models from abroad? Is there a financial advantage to doing so? The answer is both yes and no, and it depends on the iPhone model you are buying. But before we get into that, let's take a look at the pricing of the iPhone 15 models in India.Apple iPhone 15 series India pricingApple iPhone 15: Starts at Rs 79,900Apple iPhone 15 Plus: Starts at Rs 89,900Apple iPhone 15 Pro: Starts at Rs 1,34,900Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max: Starts at Rs 1,59,900Now, the price difference between Pro models is more and you can save up to Rs 60,000 when buying them from abroad. It depends upon the country you are buying the iPhone from. Buying iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus from abroad: Price difference On one hand, you can save a lot with iPhone 15 Pro models, but the price difference between the non-Pro models -- iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus -- is not that much and buying it from abroad won’t be a really good idea. Let us explain:Before that let’s take a look at how much the non-Pro models cost in Dubai, the US and Singapore.Apple iPhone 15 series US pricingApple iPhone 15: Starts at $799 (approximately Rs 66,315)Apple iPhone 15 Plus: Starts at $899 (approximately Rs 74,654)Apple iPhone 15 series Dubai pricingApple iPhone 15: Starts at AED 3,399 (approximately Rs 76,946)Apple iPhone 15 Plus: Starts at AED 3,799 (approximately Rs 86,001)Apple iPhone 15 series Singapore pricingApple iPhone 15: Starts at S$1,299 (approximately Rs 79,217)Apple iPhone 15 Plus: Starts at S$1,449 (approximately Rs 88,448)How much you’ll actually saveWhen buying the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus from the US, the price difference is around Rs 13,000 and Rs 15,246. At first glance, the price difference seems to be big. However, considering Apple is offering an additional discount of Rs 5,000 on non-Pro models in India on HDFC cards, the price difference reduces to Rs 9,000 and Rs 10,000 which is still decent but not as much. Things become even more interesting when buying them from Dubai and Singapore. First up, the price difference is not much. It’s somewhere around Rs 3,000 for Dubai and almost similar to Singapore. In fact, you can get these two phones cheaper here in India including a bank discount of Rs 5,000. One more caseIf you’ll notice the price history of the newer iPhone models, they are often found selling at a much lower price after a couple of months of the launch or let’s say around the Diwali sale. Last year, the iPhone 14 was available for purchase at Rs 67,000 including the additional bank discount. It is expected that the iPhone 15 will also be selling at a relatively more affordable price after a couple of months. This makes the case of buying the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus from the US a lot less beneficial.\",\n",

While the two Shah Rukh Khan starrers have been able to reach Rs 1000 crore mark, Sunny Deol\\'s film has crossed Rs 500 crore in the Indian market. Reflecting on the massive success of these Bollywood films, Salman Khan said that it is now time to look at new benchmarks like Rs 1000 crore as the coveted Rs 100 crore club has now become a thing of the past. At the trailer launch of Punjabi actor Gippy Grewal’s upcoming film Maujaan Hi Maujaan, it was mentioned how Punjabi films are doing exceptionally well at the box office. To which, Salman added that the way movies across industries are raking in moolah and setting new benchmarks, the new normal in the North is going to be Rs 500-600 crore. \"I feel this Rs 100 crore mark is going to be the rock bottom now. Everything is going to be Rs 400-500-600 crore plus now for the Punjabi industry, Hindi industry, every industry. Even Marathi films are doing those numbers right now. Basically, people are going to the theatres once again to watch movies. I think Rs 100 crore is not going to be a very big deal. I think the benchmark should be Rs 1000 crore for a film right now,\" Salman said at the event. Gippy Grewal’s last film Carry on Jatta 3 had smashed all previous records and grossed over Rs 100 crore worldwide. The Punjabi actor said that he\\'s hoping Maujaan Hi Maujaan will earn big at the box office. He also said that they used to get surprised when Punjabi films used to do business of Rs 10-15 crore. Last time, when they were asked if Carry on Jatta 3 can do Rs 100 crore, they didn\\'t want to say anything but by God\\'s grace, everything went well. He also mentioned that if Salman is saying such things then something huge will happen.

       " 'WASHINGTON: Justin Trudeau\\'s efforts to put India in the dock -- ostensibly for domestic political survival -- for the unsolved murder of a Khalistani radical is backfiring spectacularly with growing global and national scrutiny of Canada\\'s harboring of extremists on the run from India. While the episode is also drawing attention to the Modi government\\'s hardline approach to national security and its treatment of minorities in India, Trudeau\\'s domestic standing and the reputation of his government, which survives on support from a pro-Khalistan Sikh leader, is taking a beating. The Canadian Prime Minister spent much of Wednesday canvassing support at the United Nations for his sketchy allegation that New Delhi engineered the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar -- a terrorist fugitive from India who emigrated to Canada -- with little to show for it. Canadian officials said he met leaders of Kenya, Chile, Italy, Germany and the European Union and apprised them of the spat with India among other matters. But readouts from Trudeau\\'s office about the meetings made no mention of the issue, and none of the countries involved made any mention of the hot-button issue between Canada and India. Instead, sections of the Canadian media zeroed in on the sketchy language of Trudeau\\'s accusation against New Delhi (\"credible allegations\" and \"potential\" links among other hedge language), suggesting he had jumped the gun in his eagerness to use the issue to shore up his political standing amid tanking poll numbers. \"It’s important to remember Trudeau’s accusation has yet to be proven....(he has) so far failed to provide any evidence to Canadians,\" the National Post said in an editorial, pointing to \"his use of vague language and lack of any specific intelligence.\"\"If it turns out that Trudeau dropped this metaphorical bomb without having all his ducks in order, it will be a huge scandal, with massive domestic and geopolitical ramifications,\" it added. A recent poll by the Angus Reid Institute cited by the Canadian media showed Trudeau now has an approval rating of just 33 per cent, against a disapproval rating of 63 per cent. His Liberal government survives on support from the 24-member New Democratic Party, whose leader Jagmeet Singh is said to be sympathetic to the Khalistan cause. Meanwhile, there is also renewed scrutiny of the slain extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, whose deification as a saint is undermined by videos on social media showing him training with assault weapons and celebrating the assassination of Indian political leaders and an army general. Disquiet about Trudeau\\'s coddling of the Khalistani constituency is also riffling through his Liberal Party, particularly after Nijjar\\'s lawyer, separatist gadabout Gurpatwant Pannu, warned Canadian Hindus to go back to India in a toxic hate video.Accusing Pannu, a US-based Sikh extremist, of trying to provoke Hindu-Canadians and dividing Hindu and Sikh communities in Canada, Chandra Arya, an MP from Trudeau\\'s Liberal Party, pointed out that \"vast majority of our Canadian Sikh brothers and sisters do not support Khalistan movement.\"\"Most Sikh Canadians may not publicly condemn the Khalistan movement for several reasons but they are deeply connected to the Hindu-Canadian community. Canadian Hindus and Sikhs are connected through family relationships and shared social and cultural ties,\" he said. In an implicit condemnation of his own party leader and government, Arya tweeted, \"I can’t understand how glorification of terrorism or a hate crime targeting a religious group is allowed in the name of freedom of speech and expression. There would be an outrage in Canada if a white supremist attacked any group of racialized Canadians asking them to get out of our country. But apparently this Khalistani leader can get away with this hate crime.\"',\n",
       " 'BENGALURU: The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), which gave the command to put Chandrayaan-3 lander (Vikram) and rover (Pragyan) in sleep mode on September 3, is waiting to see if they wake up again as the Sun rose again on Moon.“It would have been easy if there was a way we could know if they would wake up, but we have to wait and see how systems behave after Sunrise,” Isro chairman S Somanath told TOI. He had said earlier that if the systems survived the night and they are able to wake up again, that process would happen automatically. Sunrise on Moon happened early Wednesday but Vikram and Pragyan would need the right Sun elevation angle to warm up again and wake up. “The optimal Sun elevation angle for systems to work would be 6° to 9°. The temperature has to rise above a certain threshold too. For the wake up, we need power generation and temperature on the elements on Vikram and Pragyan to meet certain criteria. We should know something by September 21 or 22. If they wake up, it’ll wake up during this time,” M Sankaran, director, UR Rao Satellite Centre, the Chandrayaan-3 lead centre, told TOI. Multiple Isro scientists TOI spoke with reiterated that Vikram and Pragyan waking would be a bonus and that the data the two have sent when they were awake is expected to give new information given that all earlier in situ experiments were carried out in the equatorial region of the Moon.Both Vikram and Pragyan have achieved their primary mission objectives of soft-landing on Moon, roving on its surface and conducting in situ experiments. In fact, Vikram even performed a short lunar hop which Isro termed was beyond the initial mission objectives.',\n",

Other security equipment were installed as well as part of a foolproof arrangement.However, Trudeau\\'s delegation decided not to stay in the suite and instead opted for normal rooms, sending Indian security officials into a tizzy. Multiple rounds of negotiations followed in the next few hours during which Indian sleuths insisted that the protocols be followed to help ensure security.

It has been learnt that the Canadians offered to pay for the presidential suite as well despite staying in regular rooms.Sources speculated that Trudeau could have been just following the instructions of his security team which may have had their own apprehensions in the wake of the tense relationship between the two countries. There was high drama after the summit as Trudeau could leave for Canada only after a delay of 36 hours as his aircraft reported a malfunction.

Reflecting on the massive success of these Bollywood films, Salman Khan said that it is now time to look at new benchmarks like Rs 1000 crore as the coveted Rs 100 crore club has now become a thing of the past. At the trailer launch of Punjabi actor Gippy Grewal’s upcoming film Maujaan Hi Maujaan, it was mentioned how Punjabi films are doing exceptionally well at the box office. To which, Salman added that the way movies across industries are raking in moolah and setting new benchmarks, the new normal in the North is going to be Rs 500-600 crore. \"I feel this Rs 100 crore mark is going to be the rock bottom now. Everything is going to be Rs 400-500-600 crore plus now for the Punjabi industry, Hindi industry, every industry. Even Marathi films are doing those numbers right now. Basically, people are going to the theatres once again to watch movies. I think Rs 100 crore is not going to be a very big deal. I think the benchmark should be Rs 1000 crore for a film right now,\" Salman said at the event.

He skirted reference to the evidence but maintained that there are \"credible reasons to believe that agents of the Government of India were involved.\"While India has said that Canada had not provided any evidence on the matter, Trudeau called on New Delhi \"to engage with us to move forward on getting to the truth of this matter\" after going public with what he first described as \"credible allegations.\" Trudeau also ducked a question about about lack of international support for his sketchy allegations, asserting that Canada stood for rule of law and and would stand up for an international rules-based order and \"it\\'s something we are doing alongside our allies.\"New Delhi, which also asserts that it stands for similar values, has accused Canada of being a safe haven for extremist fugitives from India. Some of them have wrought havoc in the past, including downing an Air India plane in which 329 people were killed, most of them Canadian citizens. They have also attacked moderate Sikhs opposed to the Khalistan cause, threatened others Indians, diplomats, and officials, and preached and perpetrated violence in Canadian society. The issue has bedeviled ties between the two countries for nearly four decades. Asked if the Nijjar murder, assuming he produced of evidence New Delhi\\'s involvement, would take a backseat to the \"harsh reality of international geo-politics\" given India\\'s growing importance, Trudeau said, \"There is no question that India is a country of growing importance and a country that we need to continue to work with, not just in the region but around the world. And we\\'re not looking to provoke or are cause problems.\" \"But we are unequivocal around the importance of the rule of law and unequivocal about the importance of protecting Canadians and standing up for our values. That\\'s why we call upon the government of India, to work with us to establish processes to discover and to uncover the truth of the matter and to allow justice and accountability to be served,\" he added.',\n",
       " \"Owning a motorcycle brings with it a sense of freedom and adventure. But like any vehicle, motorcycles can encounter mechanical issues over time. Ideally, getting your bike serviced should be a routine activity. Perform an oil change, lubricate, and assess chain tension every six months. Monitor tyre pressure on a monthly basis. Conduct carburettor tuning and flush the cooling system for water-cooled engines every two years. While these check-ups can help you keep your bike maintained and running smoothly, at times, certain issues might prop up in your bike due to less use, driving for long periods of time or even due to extreme weather. So, whether you're a seasoned rider or a newcomer to the world of motorcycles, knowing how to troubleshoot and fix common problems can save you time, money, and frustration.Here’s a list of some of the most frequent motorcycle issues and how to address them.Dead battery: A dead battery is one of the most common issues motorcycle owners face, especially after long periods of inactivity or during colder months. If there’s silence when you try to start your bike, it's likely a battery problem. To fix this, you should charge the battery using a dedicated motorcycle battery charger. If you're frequently facing this issue, consider using a trickle charger to maintain the battery's charge when the motorcycle is not in use.Fuel issues: When your motorcycle won't start or stalls frequently, it might be due to fuel-related problems. These can be caused by old fuel, clogged filters, or issues with the fuel delivery system. In such situations, you should drain old fuel from the tank and replace it with fresh fuel. Clean or replace the fuel filter if necessary. Check fuel lines and the carburettor for any blockages or clogs.Engine overheating: Riding in hot weather or in heavy traffic can lead to engine overheating. If you notice smoke, an unusual smell, or a rising temperature gauge, your engine might be overheating. When you face this issue, pull over and let the engine cool down. Ensure the radiator and cooling fins are clean and free from debris.Brake Problems: Brakes are critical for safety, so any issues with them should be addressed immediately. If you experience spongy or unresponsive brakes, it's time to check brake fluid levels and top up if needed. Bleed the brakes to remove air bubbles from the brake lines. Inspect brake pads for wear; replace them if they're too thin. Also, examine the brake discs for any warping or damage.Electrical problems: Faulty lights, indicators, and other electrical components can compromise your visibility and safety on the road. It is best to inspect fuses for any blown ones and replace them if needed. Check wiring connections for corrosion or damage. If you're not comfortable with electrical work, it's best to consult a professional.Chain maintenance: A poorly maintained chain can lead to poor performance and even accidents. A dry or improperly tensioned chain can result in power loss and decreased handling. Therefore, it is necessary to regularly clean and lubricate the chain according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Also, you should ensure that there is proper tension—neither too tight nor too loose—in your bike chain for efficient power transfer. A good bike maintenance tip is to ensure that your motorcycle chain has a free play of 2 to 4 mm.Tyre issues: Underinflated or damaged tyres can affect your motorcycle's handling, stability, and overall safety. Inspect tyres for any signs of damage, such as cracks or punctures. Replace tyres if the tread depth is too low.Oil leaks: Oil leaks can lead to decreased engine performance and potential safety hazards. Identify the source of the leak and assess its severity. Tighten loose bolts or replace faulty gaskets. Regularly check the oil level to ensure it's within the recommended range. In case of oil leaks, seek professional help as soon as possible. While these bike problems are minor everyday inconveniences, others can be caused by unexpected accidents and burn a hole through your pocket for repairs. In such situations, having bike insurance can be vital.

       " 'NEW DELHI: The AIADMK on Thursday said it wants Narendra Modi to return again as PM after 2024 Lok Sabha elections but also expects the BJP to accept party general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami as their chief ministerial candidate in the next Tamil Nadu assembly election.The relation between the two parties had strained last week after state BJP chief Annamalai had attacked Dravidian stalwart CN Annadurai.However, in what appeared to be a softening of stance, senior AIADMK leader and former state minister Sellur K Raju today said, \"We have nothing against BJP leaders like Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and J P Nadda. But we don\\'t relish BJP state president (K Annamalai) insulting our leader C N Annadurai.\"\"We want Narendra Modi to become prime minister again. And as far as Tamil Nadu is concerned, the BJP should accept Palaniswami as the chief ministerial candidate,\" he added.Last week after Annamalai\\'s remarks on Annadurai, the AIADMK had announced that it does not have an alliance with the BJP in Tamil Nadu.Senior AIADMK leader D Jayakumar had said: \"Annamalai doesn\\'t want an alliance. He always criticises our leaders. He is unfit to be BJP state president.\"\"We can\\'t accept continuous criticism on our leaders. Annamalai already criticised our leader Jayalalithaa. At that time, we passed a resolution against Annamalai. He should have stopped this. He is criticising Anna, Periyar. No cadre would accept this,\" Jayakumar had added.Annamalai who has undertaken a yatra in Tamil Nadu to spread the base of the BJP in the state has been attacking both the ruling DMK and the AIADMK. The AIADMK would hope that its strong backing for the BJP central leadership, including PM Modi, will put Annamalai under pressure to accept its leadership in the state.(With inputs from agencies)',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: An unusually assertive head coach Rahul Dravid emphasised that a cricketer of Ravichandran Ashwin\\'s caliber should not be subjected to a \"trial.\"Conversely, someone with the remarkable talents of Suryakumar Yadav need not fret about securing his place in the World Cup squad. Dravid made these remarks on the eve of the three-match ODI series against Australia in Mohali.Ashwin has been included in the squad, along with Washington Sundar, as a potential replacement for Axar Patel in case the spin-bowling all-rounder is unable to recover from his quadricep tear.While this ODI series has been framed as a competition between Ashwin and Washington, Dravid refrains from using the term \"trial\" for a cricketer of Ashwin\\'s extensive experience and reputation.\"I will not say that for him it is a trial or anything (for Ashwin), we know his quality. This is a chance for him to play in this format and we just want to give him an opportunity to play in two or three games,\" Dravid said during the media conference.\"If we have a player like Ashwin, who we can rely upon if someone is injured, it\\'s a blessing for us. It\\'s a good chance for him to test himself because he has not played 50-over cricket for a long time,\" Dravid said about the bowler, who has 151 ODI wickets in 113 games but has played only two 50-over games for India in the past six years.In case Axar can\\'t make it, Ashwin will be an ideal candidate to bat at No. 8 with his years of experience.\"Someone like Ashwin provides you that experience, that ability to also contribute with the bat at No. 8. Someone we always thought of that in case, there are certain opportunities opened, he is someone, who is definitely a part of your plans,\" Dravid explained the rationale behind calling Ashwin to play this format after 19 months.In case of Suryakumar, the \\'Wall\\' was more or less bullish the team is fully backing the T20 stalwart to come good in a version where has an average of less than 25 in 27 ODIs.So, should Surya worry about September 27, the day India will announce its final 15 for the World Cup?\"I don\\'t think Surya needs to worry about the 27th. That\\'s not why we picked our team for the World Cup, and Surya is in it and we have made our decision to do that and we completely back it,\" said an assertive Dravid while backing the right-hander from Mumbai.\"We back him (Surya) because he has quality and ability that we have seen. Yes, we know, we have at the moment, seen it in T20 cricket but we know the kind of impact a player like him can make. He can change the course of a game and we completely back him, we are clear about that,\" Dravid added.The coach said Surya will play the first two games, if not all three and he is confident that he will come good.\"There is total clarity on the fact that we are completely behind him and hopefully he will be able to turn it around.\"Hopefully, he is someone who will get these three games and at least the first couple certainly to be able to develop and continue his journey as an ODI cricketer. But in terms of selection, we made our decision.\"It is also learnt that the fast-bowling unit will be rotated during the series to keep it fresh for the marquee event, something which has led the team management to rest both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.\"People like Virat and Rohit specifically, from our perspective, it\\'s really important to get them to that World Cup in a physical and mental space that they want to be in. They know how they need to prepare themselves and a lot of these decisions are made in discussions with them,\" he clarified.The team management does make exceptions for senior players, who have their own routines and know their body well.\"Senior and more experienced guys have their routines and know how they want to prepare in the lead-up to a big event like the World Cup.\"I think, based on those discussions, we come up with mutual decisions to just take off and refresh mentally more than anything else.

       " \"Lohum, producer of lithium-ion battery materials through recycling and repurposing in India, has signed a partnership agreement with Nepal, to deliver 25,000 metric tonnes of EV battery materials by 2028. Nepal is currently in the process of finding solutions to upscale its clean energy capacity across the board. Chinese battery material imports currently dominate the Nepal market, however, the solution that its new partnership with Lohum presents, will help it to increase its clean energy without sacrificing on its sovereignty, economy or natural resources. Under the guidelines of the partnership, Lohum will recycle and repurpose an estimated 200,000 batteries in Nepal and extract re-usable EV battery material such as lithium, nickel and cobalt to the tune of 25,000 metric tonnes. This will happen over a period of 5 years with an aim to make Nepal energy-abundant and self-sustaining. Nepal’s objective is to take a foundational step towards diversifying its sources of clean energy and move away from its dependence on Chinese materials. The move is also aligned with India's commitment towards affordable and inclusive energy for all nations worldwide and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The partnership with Lohum will further help Nepal’s EV ecosystem and its stakeholders to become compliant with the country’s Aarthik Vidheyak policy for management of end-of-life battery waste, introduced by the Government of Nepal in FY 2023. Moreover, the recycled materials will then recirculate in Nepal’s battery ecosystem indefinitely. In terms of Nepal and its EV ecosystem, major EV manufacturers such as Tata Motors, Citroen and MG are currently selling battery electric vehicles in the neighbouring country. The pool of BEVs in Nepal is projected to grow with incoming models from other major OEMS such as Volkswagen, Suzuki, Renault, and Mahindra Electric. Once, batteries from these cars enter the ecosystem then recycling and repurposing technologies like that of Lohumi, will further help Nepal become clean energy independent.\",\n",

Gippy Grewal’s last film Carry on Jatta 3 had smashed all previous records and grossed over Rs 100 crore worldwide. The Punjabi actor said that he\\'s hoping Maujaan Hi Maujaan will earn big at the box office. He also said that they used to get surprised when Punjabi films used to do business of Rs 10-15 crore. Last time, when they were asked if Carry on Jatta 3 can do Rs 100 crore, they didn\\'t want to say anything but by God\\'s grace, everything went well. He also mentioned that if Salman is saying such things then something huge will happen. To this, Salman joked that they shouldn\\'t rely on his words because his predictions about his own films are going for a toss. \"Mere pe mat jana bhai, picture pe jana, kyuki mere khud ke predictions meri films pe nahi chal rahe,” he said making the audience burst into laughter.',\n",
       " \"NEW DELHI: Antim Panghal, a promising wrestler, achieved a historic milestone on Thursday by clinching the bronze medal at the 2023 World Championship in the 53kg category. This victory secured an Olympic quota for India in the same weight category for the 2024 Paris Games.Antim's triumph in the bronze-medal match was a commanding one, as she secured a convincing 16-6 victory over a two-time European Champion Jonna Malmgren of Sweden in Belgrade, Serbia.The high-scoring bout ended with a technical superiority win for the Indian, who became the first Indian wrestler -- male or female -- to lock a quota for the next year's Games.In a remarkable journey at the World Championship, Antim had previously stunned the reigning champion, Olivia Dominique Parrish, to reach the semifinals. However, her impressive run came to an end in the semifinal stage, where she lost to World No. 23 Vanesa Kaladzinskaya, a Belarusian competing as a neutral athlete, on technical points with a score of 4-5.Antim's performance underscores her development and smooth transition from the junior to senior circuit. She emerged as the two-time U-20 champion and won the first three bouts of the day to secure her spot in the semifinals, while other Indian contenders faced challenging outcomes in their respective categories.The 19-year-old Antim accomplished a remarkable feat by becoming the sixth Indian woman to secure a bronze medal at the World Championships. It's worth noting that the Indian wrestlers are participating under the United World Wrestling (UWW) flag due to the suspension of the national federation, Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), which was penalised for not holding timely elections. Despite this challenging circumstance, Antim's achievement stands as a testament to her talent and dedication in the sport of wrestling.Geeta Phogat (2012), Babita Phogat (2012), Pooja Dhanda (2018), Vinesh Phogat (2019) and Anshu Malik (silver) have won medals at the World Championships for India before.\",\n",

If these volunteers are detained, who will safeguard the Meitei villages in the vicinity of the hills and the valley from Kuki Zo militants.\"Similar endeavors to enter the Mayang Imphal police station in Imphal West district and the Andro police station in Imphal East district were also reported.In light of the apprehension of five individuals, including a suspected member of a proscribed terrorist group, on charges of extortion in Manipur, the Manipur Police has once again cautioned that stringent action will be taken against anyone exploiting their uniform for personal motives.According to officials, the five individuals were purportedly involved in extorting money from the general public and were found in possession of lethal weapons, including AK and Insas rifles, which were allegedly stolen from the police arsenal.(With agency inputs)',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: India\\'s run-machine Virat Kohli is back to his best ahead of the ICC ODI World Cup, which begins next month. Virat, who for years carried the dual responsibilities of captaincy and batting, has undergone significant changes in his batting approach recently. He\\'s become more daring, taking calculated risks and his hunger for big runs is also back.One unforgettable moment in this post-captaincy phase was his iconic innings against Pakistan in the T20 World Cup, where he played a stunning unbeaten knock of 82* off 53 balls, one of the finest performances of his career. Virat\\'s love affair with Pakistan continued in the recent Asia Cup too as he notched up his 47th ODI century against the Green Shirts, leaving him just three hundreds shy of breaking legendary Sachin Tendulkar\\'s record of 49 ODI tons. So, is Virat batting more freely now, and has relinquishing captaincy allowed him to become a much more focused batter?According to India\\'s senior spinner Amit Mishra, giving up the captaincy was a blessing for Virat.\"He is playing freely. Since he has quit his captaincy and Rohit became the captain, Virat is playing freely. He is now focussing and concentrating on his batting. With this, there is a lot of improvement in his batting,” Mishra, who is a cricket expert for JioCinema, told Timesofindia.com in an interview. \"When you are a captain, you have to focus on both aspects - your team and your batting. Now Virat is no longer a captain and his sole focus is on his batting. Since he left the captaincy, his batting has improved. He is the same Virat we saw a few years back [before the lean phase]. He is giving the same glimpse,\" Mishra said. (AP Photo) Virat stepped down from T20I captaincy after the conclusion of the T20 World Cup in October 2021 and was then relieved from ODI captaincy ahead of the South Africa tour in December later that year. Virat gave up Test captaincy less than 24 hours after India lost a series in South Africa in January 2022.\"Virat is enjoying his batting, scoring runs, always smiling, having fun on the field, and speaking to other team members. He is in a very good frame of mind currently,\" Mishra added. \\'IMPORTANT BREAK FOR VIRAT, ROHIT\\'There was considerable surprise and debate among fans and former cricketers when the selectors made the decision to rest key players like Virat, captain Rohit Sharma, and all-rounder Hardik Pandya for the first two ODIs of the upcoming three-match series against Australia.Virat, Rohit, and Pandya are the part of India squad for the third ODI.Is it justifiable to rest these star players during an ODI series, especially when it could serve as valuable preparation for the forthcoming ICC World Cup, set to commence on October 5? (AP Photo)India\\'s World Cup campaign is scheduled to begin against Australia on October 8 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.\"Ahead of a big tournament like the World Cup, big players should be given rest so that they can recharge themselves and get themselves ready, especially mentally. They can sit, think, and plan for a big tournament like the World Cup. They need to be relaxed, focused, and mentally charged up for the World Cup,\" Mishra further told TimesofIndia.com. \"This break was very important for them because they will be getting a lot of mental stress in the World Cup. So, this break was important for them. Virat and Rohit have been rested so that they can be mentally and physically ready for the World Cup.

       " \"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and devastating neurological disorder that primarily affects cognitive functions, gradually diminishing a person's ability to think, remember, and perform daily tasks. It is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for the majority of dementia cases worldwide. While Alzheimer's disease predominantly affects older adults, it is not a normal part of aging. Early detection is crucial for providing appropriate care and support to affected individuals and their families. Here are the tell-tale signs of Alzheimer's disease, shedding light on the importance of recognizing these indicators to enhance early intervention and improve the quality of life for those affected.Memory loss that disrupts daily lifeOne of the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's disease is memory loss which disrupts daily life. It is common for individuals to occasionally forget names, appointments, or where they placed their keys. However, in Alzheimer's, memory lapses become more severe and frequent, affecting a person's ability to function independently. People with Alzheimer's often forget recently learned information, important dates, and even the names of close family members or friends. They may repeatedly ask the same questions or rely on memory aids, such as notes or reminders, to compensate for their memory deficits. Challenges in planning or solving problemsAs Alzheimer's disease progresses, individuals may experience difficulty with tasks that involve planning or problem-solving. This can manifest in various ways, such as difficulty following a familiar recipe, managing finances, or organizing tasks at work. They may struggle to develop and execute plans, leading to increased reliance on others for assistance in making decisions.Difficulty completing familiar tasksAlzheimer's disease can make it increasingly challenging for individuals to complete familiar tasks they once handled with ease. This may include difficulties driving to a familiar location, managing household chores, or playing a favorite game. As cognitive abilities decline, people with Alzheimer's may require step-by-step guidance to perform activities they once did independently. Confusion about time or placePeople with Alzheimer's often become disoriented in terms of time and place. They may lose track of dates, seasons, and the passage of time. Confusion about their current location, even in a familiar environment, is also common. For instance, they may become easily disoriented within their own home.Trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationshipsAlzheimer's disease can affect a person's ability to interpret visual information accurately. Individuals may have difficulty reading, judging distances, or determining colors and contrasts. This visual impairment can lead to problems with driving safety, navigation, and recognizing objects, contributing to increased dependence on others. New problems with words in speaking or writingLanguage difficulties are another common symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Affected individuals may struggle to find the right words in conversation, repeat themselves frequently, or have trouble following or joining in on discussions. They may also experience difficulty with written language, such as writing coherent sentences or expressing their thoughts clearly.Misplacing items and poor judgmentAlzheimer's can result in changes in judgment and decision-making. Individuals may exhibit poor judgment when dealing with money, such as giving away large sums to telemarketers or making unwise investments. They may also misplace items and accuse others of theft, even though they were the ones who put the items in an unusual location.Watch the video Withdrawal from social or work activitiesAlzheimer's disease often leads to social withdrawal and a decline in the desire to engage in previously enjoyed activities. Individuals may become increasingly passive, avoid social interactions, or neglect hobbies and interests. This withdrawal can result from a combination of cognitive challenges and awareness of their declining abilities.Changes in mood and personalityAlzheimer's disease can bring about changes in mood and personality. Individuals may exhibit mood swings, becoming easily upset, anxious, or agitated. They may also experience periods of confusion, suspicion, or depression. Changes in personality may include a loss of motivation or interest in previously important pursuits.Decreased or poor judgmentA decline in judgment is a common symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Individuals may make poor decisions, such as wearing inappropriate clothing for the weather or failing to recognize when they need medical attention. They may also become susceptible to financial exploitation or fall victim to scams due to impaired judgment.\",\n",
       " \"The tit-for-tat expulsions of Indian and Canadian diplomats following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s accusation of India’s involvement in the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a known Khalistani terrorist, has exposed the velvet glove treatment Ottawa gives Khalistani extremists operating on Canadian soil.Trudeau’s government has refused not only to clamp down on subversive activities by Khalistani terror groups in Canada, it has stitched an alliance of convenience with Jagmeet Singh’s New Democratic Party. Singh backs a referendum on Khalistan and has attended pro-Khalistan rallies across Canada. Trudeau relies on Singh’s 24 parliamentary seats to survive as prime minister.Watch: India rejects Trudeau's statement on Nijjar Sikhs in Canada number just 770,000 or 2% of the country’s population. Only a small fraction back Khalistani separatism. But it is this violent fringe that Trudeau cosies up to.Is political survival the only reason for Trudeau’s inaction against Sikh extremism in Canada? Freedom of expression, which Trudeau cites in his defence, isn’t freedom to incite violence. The terrorist group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) is proscribed in India. In Canada it functions freely, organising rallies and publicly threatening to assassinate Indian diplomats in Canada.SFJ backed the 2021 farmers’ agitation. It instigated violence that led to a near-riot and fatalities. Trudeau says little about SFJ. Several members of his cabinet, which is packed with Sikhs and other politicians of Indian origin, bend over backwards to appease Sikh extremists, including the SFJ.Where’s the evidence?Trudeau accuses Indian intelligence of “organising” the assassination of Nijjar, a known Khalistani terrorist, near a gurdwara in Canada.What evidence has been offered to show the involvement of Indian intelligence in Nijjar’s assassination? The evidence is at best slender. The Anglo-Saxon media, however, has jumped to Trudeau’s defence. Britain’s The Guardian wrote on September 19: “Justin Trudeau has said there is ‘credible evidence’ that India is responsible for the alleged assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a prominent Canadian Sikh leader. The Canadian prime minister told the House of Commons of Canada on Monday that, in recent weeks, national security authorities had been probing allegations that New Delhi was behind a state-sponsored assassination.”The Economist hinted darkly that the US, Britain and Australia would get involved in the controversy. However, apart from issuing statements in Washington, DC, and Canberra, expressing concern over the situation, neither country has sought to intervene. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the issue will not affect India-UK relations despite Canada’s attempt to draw Britain in. Western countries have long practised double standards. The US carries out assassinations routinely of terrorists like Osama bin Laden. It has also targeted for assassination, though unsuccessfully, foreign leaders like Cuba’s Fidel Castro, Chile’s Salvadore Allende and President Sukarno of Indonesia.Canada’s head of state is still the British monarch, currently King Charles III. Canada’s origin lies in British colonist-loyalists in the newly independent US fleeing north to Canada.The US defeated the British in the war of independence from 1776 to 1783. British colonists loyal to the “mother country” established Canada as a British dominion, usurped indigenous native land and pushed them into isolated Reservations.It is not a history white Canadians are proud of.Watch: All you need to know about Hardeep Nijjar Justin Trudeau himself is a political dynast. Son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, he has French lineage. The colonial French fought the colonial British for control of Canada. The French won the province of Quebec, which remains determinedly French-speaking even today.Pierre Trudeau wanted to secede from Canada and make Quebec a sovereign country. After an unsuccessful referendum in 1995, Quebec dropped its independence claim. Given this background, it is not entirely surprising that dynast Justin Trudeau has a soft corner for Khalistani separatists.Meanwhile in PunjabIn Punjab, Pakistan has tried for decades to foment Khalistani extremism in the sensitive border state. It took Punjab police 78 days to arrest pro-Khalistani preacher Amritpal Singh, revealing how the Aam Aadmi Party government of chief minister Bhagwant Mann has failed to control Sikh extremism in the state. Pakistan continues to drop weapons and drugs in Punjab.The Khalistani separatist movement, however, has little traction in Punjab. Most Khalistani extremists have moved to greener pastures in Canada and Britain where they receive kid-gloves treatment. That enhances the host countries’ democratic credentials. In Canada’s case, it keeps the Trudeau government in power.India has, meanwhile, paused talks with Canada on a free trade agreement. A Canadian trade delegation due to visit India shortly has been told to cancel the trip.India does not tolerate secessionist activity on its soil by separatists of other countries — even with hostile nations like China. Since 1959, when he arrived in India from Tibet, the Dalai Lama has been prohibited from political activity that could be seen as secessionist.Other countries, especially those in the Anglosphere like Canada, are not as sensitive. For them, India must now discard the velvet glove that cloaks its iron fist.\",\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: The AAP government in Delhi has constructed roads with a cumulative length of 3,500 km and laid 2,500-km-long sewer and water pipelines in unauthorised colonies, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday. Earlier those living in unauthorised colonies of Delhi were victims of politics and they were short-changed by politicians who made promises to them but did not do anything, Kejriwal said after inaugurating some development projects in Khirki Extension and Panchsheel Colony in south Delhi. \"I am not here to do politics. I only know how to work for the people,\" the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief said, citing various works done by his government in its nine-year rule. There are around 1,800 unauthorised colonies in Delhi and only 250 were provided with roads in the past. After the AAP came to power, 850 other colonies were provided with roads. \"We constructed 3,500-km-long roads in these colonies. It\\'s not less than any miracle,\" he said, adding roads will be constructed in the remaining colonies by December this year. He said that while 884 colonies were provided with water pipelines in the 70 years before his government assumed office in 2015, all the colonies got pipelines since. A total of 2,500-km-long sewer and water pipelines were laid in the unauthorised colonies under his government, he stated. The AAP government also laid sewer lines in 750 colonies while just 230 had the facility earlier, he said. Kejriwal said although powers of his government were snatched through an ordinance (now replaced by the GNCTD Amendment Act, 2023), his government was working for the people of Delhi. \"I believe that unless every child is provided good education and every person good healthcare, India cannot become number one country in the world. We will do this wherever AAP forms government,\" said the AAP national convener. Citing the \"dilapidated condition\" of government schools in the country, Kejriwal said the AAP government turned around its schools in nine years and now children from private schools were switching to them. He also cited his government\\'s works in the health sector through Mohalla Clinics and upgradation of government hospitals. Under the free pilgrimage scheme of the AAP government, more than 75,000 elderly people of Delhi have been sent to various places in the country, he added.(With PTI inputs)',\n",

In 2022, Indians comprised 40% of total international students studying in Canada, with post-grad studies even more popular. The total number of Indian students in Canada on study visas has crossed 3 lakh. \"Canada has always been viewed as a safe, friendly country for college and for settling down thereafter,\" says education consultant Viral Doshi. \"In the last 24 hours, I have received at least five calls from parents saying they\\'d like to look at other options, in case the diplomatic tussle aggravates further.\"KP Singh, head of a Mumbai consultancy service, adds that parents who were looking at a January admission are planning to wait until there is more clarity. Indian students, who are already studying in Canadian universities are beginning to sense that something is off. Akash Mistry, who just completed a month in Ontario, said things are fine on the ground. \"Some students are anxious, but we are all trying to stay away from rumours. Nobody will want to return in a hurry after investing time and money here,\" says Mistry. Canada is viewed as a great option for Indians not just for its educational institutions, but also the prospect of getting residency there.

It\\'s an important step towards leveraging capabilities of Indian SATCOM technologies and advances in the space domain for Army formations deployed in forward and harsh terrain conditions,\" he added.The older Satcom sets with the Army have become obsolete over the years, with troops on long-range patrols along the 3,488-km LAC often not able to effectively communicate with their operating bases and the military hierarchy.\"Such forward deployed troops have to depend on terrestrial radio and satellite phones, which are not secure and have poor connectivity.

       " \"HANGZHOU: India's three leading female wushu players - all hailing from Arunachal Pradesh- who are part of the country's Asian Games contingent were forced to stay back in Delhi even as other team members reached Hangzhou Thursday morning. The trio didn't receive necessary clearances from Chinese authorities to enter the mainland, TOI has learnt.The players, Nyeman Wangsu, Onilu Tega and Mepung Lamgu, were scheduled to fly out as part of an 11-member wushu contingent - seven male and four female athletes - on a Cathay Pacific flight Wednesday night from IGI airport in New Delhi. They were to take part in individual events of the martial arts sport. The trio are now accommodated at Sports Authority of India's JLN hostel till the issue of their participation is resolved. Visa issue: Wushu players meet RijijuThe wushu competitions will run from September 24 to 28 at the Guali Cultural Sports Centre in Xiaoshan district. In July, a 12-member wushu team’s trip to Chengdu for the World University Games was called off after the Chinese embassy in Delhi issued ‘stapled visas’ to the same trio of Arunachal athletes, prompting an angry reaction from India’s external affairs ministry which termed the move “unacceptable”. In the latest incident, the three athletes, according to sources in the Wushu Association of India (WAI), were not being cleared to proceed beyond Hong Kong to China after their accreditation cards could not be downloaded for validation. They were booked on a Delhi-Hong Kong-Hangzhou route. “Their clearances have not arrived to enter China. We, at the federation, were unable to download their accreditation cards for the Games while the remaining members of the team could download theirs without any issues. The accreditation card acts as your visa. So, we decided to leave without them, hoping they could join the team before the competitions begin,” one of the sources said. “Our chef-de-mission, Bhupendra Singh Bajwa, has already taken up the matter with the Asian Games organising committee while the Indian government has also been apprised of the matter. Bajwa has reached the Athletes’ Village in Hangzhou and will be discussing the matter with the organisers — the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA). In fact, Bajwa and Indian Olympic Association’s joint secretary and acting CEO Kalyan Chaubey had met the Chinese ambassador in Delhi some time ago to discuss the difficulty faced by some athletes in securing accreditation,” the source added. It’s been learnt that the three players met former union sports minister Kiren Rijiju on Thursday afternoon and requested his intervention to secure their passage for participation at the Games. Rijiju is a three-time MP in Lok Sabha from Arunachal Pradesh and currently holds the portfolio of minister of earth sciences. After the meeting, Rijiju held discussions with the senior ranking officials in the govt of India and sought early resolution of the issue. According to sources, the sports ministry later held a meeting in the evening and decided to take up the matter diplomatically.\",\n",
       " 'GUWAHATI: At least 15 people were wounded in Manipur\\'s Imphal valley on Thursday as protesters clashed with security forces when they tried to storm police stations and court arrest, demanding the unconditional release of five men arrested on Saturday for impersonating policemen and carrying firearms.As a precautionary measure, the state government clamped total curfew in Imphal East and Imphal West districts. The curfew relaxation hours, which were in effect from 5am to 9pm on Thursday, were withdrawn from 5pm, and restrictions on movement were enforced in all areas of the two adjoining valley districts. The protesters, responding to a call by six local clubs and Meira Paibis (women activists), demonstrated by holding placards and shouting slogans while attempting to enter Andro and Porompat police stations in Imphal East, and Singjamei, Kwakeithel and Mayang Imphal police outposts in Imphal West district.They demanded the release of the five arrested men, claiming that they were village defence volunteers.In response, police and RAF personnel used tear gas shells to disperse the crowds. The five men remain in police custody. According to police, one of them is a trained member of a banned militant outfit of the state, while another is a drug addict running a rehabilitation centre.Eralier, normal life in the Imphal valley was paralysed by a 48-hour bandh called by Meira Paibis and local clubs, demanding the release of the arrested men. The bandh ended Wednesday. The organisations asked people to assemble at their nearest police station on Thursday. Security forces conducted search operations in various districts, recovering arms and ammunition, including mortar shells. A joint team of Assam Rifles and state police seized four mortar bombs hidden in bushes during a search in Kangpokpi district.\"Search operations were conducted by security forces in the fringe and vulnerable areas of Imphal West, Thoubal, Bishnupur, Kangpokpi and Churachandpur districts in which one arm, two local pumpi guns, 50 ammunition and eight explosives were recovered from Imphal West and Kangpokpi districts,\" the police tweeted.Police have installed 127 checkpoints in the valley and hill districts and detained 873 people on Wednesday for violating rules. Strict security measures have been implemented in vulnerable locations, and security convoys are providing safe passage for vehicles in sensitive areas. HC cuts fine on two convicted rebels, paves way for releaseDelhi high court on Thursday reduced the fine imposed on two convicted members of Manipur-based terrorist organisation Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP), who had pleaded guilty in a terror case, saying their admission of guilt is a clear indication of possibility of reform. Paving the way for their release after seven years behind bars, HC reduced the fine from Rs 39,000 to Rs 9,000 each, imposed on convicts Khoiram Ranjit Singh and Pukhrihongam Prem Kumar Meiti after taking note that their families are not in a financial position to pay the entire amount as a result of which the duo will have no alternative but undergo default sentence of additional 30 months. A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anish Dayal said there is no reason why they are being penalised for their poor financial condition since that has no relation to the sentence undergone for the offences they were convicted of.',\n",

       " \"NEW DELHI: Describing Canada as a haven for terrorists, a characterisation it had used so far only for Pakistan, the government Thursday suspended visa processing services in the North American country saying Indian diplomats were unable to perform their duties because of the threats they faced from Khalistan forces. Reiterating that Canadian diplomats were involved in anti-India activities, India also asked Canada to reduce its diplomatic strength here. The government said there had to be parity between diplomatic presence in both countries as Canada had a much stronger presence here than the other way around.India Canada News Live UpdatesAmid the raging diplomatic dispute over allegations by Canadian PM Justin Trudeau that India might be involved in the killing of Khalistan leader and Canadian national Hardeep Singh Nijjar, the government also suspended e-visa facility for Canadian citizens and said they won't be allowed to apply for Indian visa even from third countries. With Canada yet to provide any evidence or even information linking India to the killing, the Centre called Trudeau’s allegations ``politically motivated’’ and marked by prejudice as Canada had expelled an Indian diplomat only on the basis of allegations. 'Take action': India gives list of 20 Khalistan ultras to Canada While India has asked Canada to reduce its staff strength, and the details are still being worked out, whether the government formally downgrades diplomatic ties will likely depend on how Canada reacts to the move. MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India was ready to look into any specific piece of evidence or information from Canada, but so far nothing had been shared. India also called upon Canada to act on a list of more than 20 Khalistan terrorists it has shared with Canadian authorities several times in the past.``We have provided very specific information to Canada but it has not been acted upon. We have shared the same list many times in the past too,’’ said Bagchi, adding that it’s Canada that needs to worry about any reputational harm as terrorism is being funded and supported and safe haven provided there. ``Canada’s reputation as a safe haven for terrorism and extremism is growing,’’ said the Indian official, adding that Canada’s inaction against such forces had forced India to stall visa operations. He said the main issue between the 2 countries was terrorism and called upon Canada to act against pro-Khalistan forces. While the US and Australia have said that they engaged India on Trudeau’s allegations, the Indian government is also in touch with close partners over the issue.The last time India was involved in a diplomatic row of such intensity with a Western country was in 2013-14 with the US in the Devyani Khobragade case but India had then not asked the Americans to reduce the strength of their diplomatic missions here. In fact, in recent memory, India has only asked Pakistan to do so, in 2020, because of the involvement of Pakistani diplomats in, as India had then said, terrorist activities. On this occasion too, the government said Canada had been asked to cut staff strength because of their participation in anti-India activities. The Canadian high commission also said it's looking to ``adjust'' staff presence in India but added it was because of the threats faced by Canadian diplomats in India. Canada, however, said its high commission and consulates remained functional and were serving clients. ``In light of the current environment where tensions have heightened, we are taking action to ensure the safety of our diplomats. With some diplomats having received threats on various social media platforms, Global Affairs Canada is assessing its staff complement in India. As a result, and out of an abundance of caution, we have decided to temporarily adjust staff presence in India,’’ said the Canadian high commission, adding that it expected India to provide for the security of diplomats and consular officers in India in line with the Vienna conventions.\",\n",
       " 'TORONTO: The allegation of India’s involvement in the killing of a Sikh Canadian is based on human and surveillance intelligence, including signals intelligence of Indian diplomats in Canada, an official familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Thursday.The official said that the communications involved Indian officials and Indian diplomats in Canada and that some of the intelligence was provided by a member of the “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance — US, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, did not say which ally provided the intelligence or give any specific details of what was contained in the intelligence.The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation first reported details of the intelligence.Earlier Thursday, India told Canada to reduce its diplomatic staff and stopped issuing visas to Canadian citizens as a rift widened between the once-close allies over Ottawa’s allegation that New Delhi may have been involved in the killing of the Canadian citizen.Ties between the two countries — key strategic partners in security and trade — have plunged to their lowest point in years since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were “credible allegations” of Indian involvement in the assassination of the Sikh separatist activist in June in a Vancouver suburb.Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a 45-year-old Canadian citizen who had been wanted by India for years, was gunned down outside the temple he led in the city of Surrey. Nijjar, a plumber, was born in India but became a Canadian citizen in 2007.Speaking on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, Trudeau acknowledged the complicated diplomatic situation he faced.“There is no question that India is a country of growing importance and a country that we need to continue to work with,\" he said. “We are not looking to provoke or cause problems but we are unequivocal around the importance of the rule of law and unequivocal about the importance of protecting Canadians.”The bombshell Monday allegation by Trudeau set off an international tit-for-tat, with each country expelling a diplomat. India called the allegations “absurd.”Canada has yet to provide any public evidence to back Trudeau\\'s allegations, and Canada\\'s U.N. ambassador, Bob Rae ,indicated Thursday that it might not come very soon. “This is very early days,” Rae told reporters at the United Nations, insisting that while facts will emerge, they must “come out in the course of the pursuit of justice.”\"That’s what we call the rule of law in Canada,” he said.On Thursday, the company that processes Indian visas in Canada announced that visa services had been suspended until further notice. The BLS Indian Visa Application Center gave no further details.The suspension means Canadians who don’t already have visas will not be able to travel to India until services resume. Canadians are among the top travelers to India. In 2021, 80,000 Canadian tourists visited the country, according to India’s Bureau of Immigration.Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi blamed the visa suspension, which includes visas issued in third countries, on safety issues.“Security threats being faced by our High Commission and consulates in Canada have disrupted their normal functioning. Accordingly, they are temporarily unable to process visa applications,” Bagchi told reporters. \"We will be reviewing the situation on a regular basis.\"He gave no details on the alleged threats.The announcement quickly rippled across Canada, especially among people with ties to India.Sukhwinder Dhillon, a 56-year-old grocery store owner in Montreal, said he had a trip planned to his birthplace in India to see family and sort out his deceased father’s estate. Dhillon, who came to Canada in 1998, said he makes the trip back every two or three years, and he has lost two people in his immediate family since he was last home.“My father passed, and my brother passed,” Dhillon said. “I want to go now ... Now I don’t know when we’ll go.”Bagchi, the Indian foreign ministry spokesman, also called for a reduction in Canadian diplomats in India, saying they outnumbered Indian diplomats in Canada.“We have informed the Canadian government that there should be parity\" in staffing, he said.The Canadian High Commission in New Delhi said Thursday that all its consulates in India are open and continue to serve clients. It said some of its diplomats had received threats on social media, prompting it to assess its “staff complement in India.” It added that Canada expects India to provide security for its diplomats and consular officers working there.On Wednesday, India warned its citizens to be careful when traveling to Canada because of “growing anti-India activities and politically condoned hate-crimes.”Canada has yet to provide any evidence of Indian involvement in the killing. India\\'s security and intelligence branches have long been active in South Asia and are suspected in a number of killings in Pakistan. But arranging the killing of a Canadian citizen in Canada, home to nearly 2 million people of Indian descent, would be unprecedented.Bagchi accused Canada of providing a safe haven for terrorists. He said India has regularly provided Canada with specific evidence about criminal activities by people based on its soil, but the information has not been acted upon.India has criticized Canada for years over giving free rein to Sikh separatists, including Nijjar. New Delhi had accused him of having links to terrorism, which he denied.Nijjar was a local leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland, known as Khalistan. A bloody decadelong Sikh insurgency shook north India in the 1970s and 1980s until it was crushed in a government crackdown in which thousands of people were killed, including prominent Sikh leaders.While the active insurgency ended decades ago, the Indian government has warned that Sikh separatists are trying to stage a comeback and pressed countries like Canada, where Sikhs comprise over 2% of the population, to do more in stopping them.At the time of his killing, Nijjar was working to organize an unofficial Sikh diaspora referendum on independence from India.New Delhi’s anxieties about Sikh separatist groups in Canada have long been a strain on the relationship, but the two have maintained strong defense and trade ties and share strategic interests over China’s global ambitions.In March, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government summoned the Canadian high commissioner in New Delhi, its top diplomat in the country, to complain about Sikh independence protests in Canada.But signs of a broader diplomatic rift emerged at the summit of the Group of 20 leading world economies hosted by India earlier this month. Trudeau had frosty encounters with Modi, and a few days later Canada canceled a trade mission to India planned for the fall. A trade deal between the two is now on pause.On Wednesday, India’s National Investigation Agency said it has intensified its crackdown on Sikh insurgents operating in India.It announced rewards of up to 1 million rupees ($12,000) for information leading to the arrest of five insurgents, one of whom is believed to be based in neighboring Pakistan.The agency accused them of extorting money from businesses for a banned Sikh organization, the Babbar Khalsa International, and of targeted killings in India. “They also have established a network of operatives in various countries to further their terrorist activities in India,” it said in a statement, without naming any country.India accuses Pakistan of supporting insurgencies in Kashmir and Punjab, charges that Islamabad denies.',\n",
       " 'GUWAHATI: At least 15 people were wounded in Manipur\\'s Imphal valley on Thursday as protesters clashed with security forces when they tried to storm police stations and court arrest, demanding the unconditional release of five men arrested on Saturday for impersonating policemen and carrying firearms.As a precautionary measure, the state government clamped total curfew in Imphal East and Imphal West districts. The curfew relaxation hours, which were in effect from 5am to 9pm on Thursday, were withdrawn from 5pm, and restrictions on movement were enforced in all areas of the two adjoining valley districts. The protesters, responding to a call by six local clubs and Meira Paibis (women activists), demonstrated by holding placards and shouting slogans while attempting to enter Andro and Porompat police stations in Imphal East, and Singjamei, Kwakeithel and Mayang Imphal police outposts in Imphal West district.They demanded the release of the five arrested men, claiming that they were village defence volunteers.In response, police and RAF personnel used tear gas shells to disperse the crowds. The five men remain in police custody. According to police, one of them is a trained member of a banned militant outfit of the state, while another is a drug addict running a rehabilitation centre.Eralier, normal life in the Imphal valley was paralysed by a 48-hour bandh called by Meira Paibis and local clubs, demanding the release of the arrested men. The bandh ended Wednesday. The organisations asked people to assemble at their nearest police station on Thursday. Security forces conducted search operations in various districts, recovering arms and ammunition, including mortar shells. A joint team of Assam Rifles and state police seized four mortar bombs hidden in bushes during a search in Kangpokpi district.\"Search operations were conducted by security forces in the fringe and vulnerable areas of Imphal West, Thoubal, Bishnupur, Kangpokpi and Churachandpur districts in which one arm, two local pumpi guns, 50 ammunition and eight explosives were recovered from Imphal West and Kangpokpi districts,\" the police tweeted.Police have installed 127 checkpoints in the valley and hill districts and detained 873 people on Wednesday for violating rules. Strict security measures have been implemented in vulnerable locations, and security convoys are providing safe passage for vehicles in sensitive areas. HC cuts fine on two convicted rebels, paves way for releaseDelhi high court on Thursday reduced the fine imposed on two convicted members of Manipur-based terrorist organisation Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP), who had pleaded guilty in a terror case, saying their admission of guilt is a clear indication of possibility of reform. Paving the way for their release after seven years behind bars, HC reduced the fine from Rs 39,000 to Rs 9,000 each, imposed on convicts Khoiram Ranjit Singh and Pukhrihongam Prem Kumar Meiti after taking note that their families are not in a financial position to pay the entire amount as a result of which the duo will have no alternative but undergo default sentence of additional 30 months. A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anish Dayal said there is no reason why they are being penalised for their poor financial condition since that has no relation to the sentence undergone for the offences they were convicted of.',\n",
       " \"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and devastating neurological disorder that primarily affects cognitive functions, gradually diminishing a person's ability to think, remember, and perform daily tasks. It is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for the majority of dementia cases worldwide. While Alzheimer's disease predominantly affects older adults, it is not a normal part of aging. Early detection is crucial for providing appropriate care and support to affected individuals and their families. Here are the tell-tale signs of Alzheimer's disease, shedding light on the importance of recognizing these indicators to enhance early intervention and improve the quality of life for those affected.Memory loss that disrupts daily lifeOne of the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's disease is memory loss which disrupts daily life. It is common for individuals to occasionally forget names, appointments, or where they placed their keys. However, in Alzheimer's, memory lapses become more severe and frequent, affecting a person's ability to function independently. People with Alzheimer's often forget recently learned information, important dates, and even the names of close family members or friends. They may repeatedly ask the same questions or rely on memory aids, such as notes or reminders, to compensate for their memory deficits. Challenges in planning or solving problemsAs Alzheimer's disease progresses, individuals may experience difficulty with tasks that involve planning or problem-solving. This can manifest in various ways, such as difficulty following a familiar recipe, managing finances, or organizing tasks at work. They may struggle to develop and execute plans, leading to increased reliance on others for assistance in making decisions.Difficulty completing familiar tasksAlzheimer's disease can make it increasingly challenging for individuals to complete familiar tasks they once handled with ease. This may include difficulties driving to a familiar location, managing household chores, or playing a favorite game. As cognitive abilities decline, people with Alzheimer's may require step-by-step guidance to perform activities they once did independently. Confusion about time or placePeople with Alzheimer's often become disoriented in terms of time and place. They may lose track of dates, seasons, and the passage of time. Confusion about their current location, even in a familiar environment, is also common. For instance, they may become easily disoriented within their own home.Trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationshipsAlzheimer's disease can affect a person's ability to interpret visual information accurately. Individuals may have difficulty reading, judging distances, or determining colors and contrasts. This visual impairment can lead to problems with driving safety, navigation, and recognizing objects, contributing to increased dependence on others. New problems with words in speaking or writingLanguage difficulties are another common symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Affected individuals may struggle to find the right words in conversation, repeat themselves frequently, or have trouble following or joining in on discussions. They may also experience difficulty with written language, such as writing coherent sentences or expressing their thoughts clearly.Misplacing items and poor judgmentAlzheimer's can result in changes in judgment and decision-making. Individuals may exhibit poor judgment when dealing with money, such as giving away large sums to telemarketers or making unwise investments. They may also misplace items and accuse others of theft, even though they were the ones who put the items in an unusual location.Watch the video Withdrawal from social or work activitiesAlzheimer's disease often leads to social withdrawal and a decline in the desire to engage in previously enjoyed activities. Individuals may become increasingly passive, avoid social interactions, or neglect hobbies and interests. This withdrawal can result from a combination of cognitive challenges and awareness of their declining abilities.Changes in mood and personalityAlzheimer's disease can bring about changes in mood and personality. Individuals may exhibit mood swings, becoming easily upset, anxious, or agitated. They may also experience periods of confusion, suspicion, or depression. Changes in personality may include a loss of motivation or interest in previously important pursuits.Decreased or poor judgmentA decline in judgment is a common symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Individuals may make poor decisions, such as wearing inappropriate clothing for the weather or failing to recognize when they need medical attention. They may also become susceptible to financial exploitation or fall victim to scams due to impaired judgment.\",\n",

       " \"Winter season is typically the one season of the year when you need to be careful about your vitamin D levels. Layers of clothing, wearing heavy sweaters and jackets, and remaining indoors to avoid the chilly wind make us less exposed to the sun during the winter season, and hence the chances of vitamin D deficiency increase. Getting enough vitamin D before winter arrives is important because during the colder months, many people may not get sufficient sunlight exposure, which is a primary source of vitamin D. Hence you have to go beyond sunlight to maintain the vitamin D levels in your body. Here are some effective ways to increase your vitamin D levels before winter:Check your vitamin D levelConsider getting a blood test to check your vitamin D level. This can help determine if you need to increase your intake or sun exposure. Vitamin D of at least 30 ng/mL is considered to be good for health. Sunlight exposureThe most natural way to obtain vitamin D is through sunlight. Spend time outdoors in the sun during the summer and early fall months when the sun is stronger. Expose your skin (arms, legs, face) to direct sunlight for about 10-30 minutes a few times a week. The amount of time needed varies depending on factors like skin tone, geographical location, and the time of day.Consume vitamin D-rich foodsInclude foods high in vitamin D in your diet. Some good dietary sources of vitamin D include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, trout), cod liver oil, egg yolks, and fortified foods (such as fortified milk, orange juice, and cereals).Don’t forget supplementsIf you have difficulty getting enough vitamin D from sunlight and diet, consider taking vitamin D supplements. Consult your healthcare provider to determine the right dosage for your specific needs, as individual requirements can vary. Morning walks can be helpfulRegular physical activity can help improve your overall health and may contribute to vitamin D synthesis. Exercise outdoors when possible. Go for morning walks and soak in the morning sun. If this is not possible, then sit under the sun for a few minutes every day. Limit sunscreen useWhile sunscreen is essential for protecting your skin from harmful UV radiation, it can also block the production of vitamin D. When you're trying to get vitamin D from sunlight, consider spending some time in the sun without sunscreen. However, be cautious not to overexpose yourself and risk sunburn.UV lampsSome people use UV lamps or light therapy boxes specifically designed to produce UVB radiation, which can stimulate the production of vitamin D in the skin. However, it's essential to use these devices under the guidance of a healthcare professional to avoid potential side effects.Take expert opinionIf you have specific health conditions or concerns about your vitamin D levels, consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice and recommendations. Do not self-medicate yourself. A doctor will help you with the right dose of vitamin D.\",\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: The AAP government in Delhi has constructed roads with a cumulative length of 3,500 km and laid 2,500-km-long sewer and water pipelines in unauthorised colonies, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday. Earlier those living in unauthorised colonies of Delhi were victims of politics and they were short-changed by politicians who made promises to them but did not do anything, Kejriwal said after inaugurating some development projects in Khirki Extension and Panchsheel Colony in south Delhi. \"I am not here to do politics. I only know how to work for the people,\" the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief said, citing various works done by his government in its nine-year rule. There are around 1,800 unauthorised colonies in Delhi and only 250 were provided with roads in the past. After the AAP came to power, 850 other colonies were provided with roads. \"We constructed 3,500-km-long roads in these colonies. It\\'s not less than any miracle,\" he said, adding roads will be constructed in the remaining colonies by December this year. He said that while 884 colonies were provided with water pipelines in the 70 years before his government assumed office in 2015, all the colonies got pipelines since. A total of 2,500-km-long sewer and water pipelines were laid in the unauthorised colonies under his government, he stated. The AAP government also laid sewer lines in 750 colonies while just 230 had the facility earlier, he said. Kejriwal said although powers of his government were snatched through an ordinance (now replaced by the GNCTD Amendment Act, 2023), his government was working for the people of Delhi. \"I believe that unless every child is provided good education and every person good healthcare, India cannot become number one country in the world. We will do this wherever AAP forms government,\" said the AAP national convener. Citing the \"dilapidated condition\" of government schools in the country, Kejriwal said the AAP government turned around its schools in nine years and now children from private schools were switching to them. He also cited his government\\'s works in the health sector through Mohalla Clinics and upgradation of government hospitals. Under the free pilgrimage scheme of the AAP government, more than 75,000 elderly people of Delhi have been sent to various places in the country, he added.(With PTI inputs)',\n",
       " 'TORONTO: The allegation of India’s involvement in the killing of a Sikh Canadian is based on human and surveillance intelligence, including signals intelligence of Indian diplomats in Canada, an official familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Thursday.The official said that the communications involved Indian officials and Indian diplomats in Canada and that some of the intelligence was provided by a member of the “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance — US, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, did not say which ally provided the intelligence or give any specific details of what was contained in the intelligence.The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation first reported details of the intelligence.Earlier Thursday, India told Canada to reduce its diplomatic staff and stopped issuing visas to Canadian citizens as a rift widened between the once-close allies over Ottawa’s allegation that New Delhi may have been involved in the killing of the Canadian citizen.Ties between the two countries — key strategic partners in security and trade — have plunged to their lowest point in years since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were “credible allegations” of Indian involvement in the assassination of the Sikh separatist activist in June in a Vancouver suburb.Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a 45-year-old Canadian citizen who had been wanted by India for years, was gunned down outside the temple he led in the city of Surrey. Nijjar, a plumber, was born in India but became a Canadian citizen in 2007.Speaking on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, Trudeau acknowledged the complicated diplomatic situation he faced.“There is no question that India is a country of growing importance and a country that we need to continue to work with,\" he said. “We are not looking to provoke or cause problems but we are unequivocal around the importance of the rule of law and unequivocal about the importance of protecting Canadians.”The bombshell Monday allegation by Trudeau set off an international tit-for-tat, with each country expelling a diplomat. India called the allegations “absurd.”Canada has yet to provide any public evidence to back Trudeau\\'s allegations, and Canada\\'s U.N. ambassador, Bob Rae ,indicated Thursday that it might not come very soon. “This is very early days,” Rae told reporters at the United Nations, insisting that while facts will emerge, they must “come out in the course of the pursuit of justice.”\"That’s what we call the rule of law in Canada,” he said.On Thursday, the company that processes Indian visas in Canada announced that visa services had been suspended until further notice. The BLS Indian Visa Application Center gave no further details.The suspension means Canadians who don’t already have visas will not be able to travel to India until services resume. Canadians are among the top travelers to India. In 2021, 80,000 Canadian tourists visited the country, according to India’s Bureau of Immigration.Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi blamed the visa suspension, which includes visas issued in third countries, on safety issues.“Security threats being faced by our High Commission and consulates in Canada have disrupted their normal functioning.

       " \"NEW DELHI: Describing Canada as a haven for terrorists, a characterisation it had used so far only for Pakistan, the government Thursday suspended visa processing services in the North American country saying Indian diplomats were unable to perform their duties because of the threats they faced from Khalistan forces. Reiterating that Canadian diplomats were involved in anti-India activities, India also asked Canada to reduce its diplomatic strength here. The government said there had to be parity between diplomatic presence in both countries as Canada had a much stronger presence here than the other way around.India Canada News Live UpdatesAmid the raging diplomatic dispute over allegations by Canadian PM Justin Trudeau that India might be involved in the killing of Khalistan leader and Canadian national Hardeep Singh Nijjar, the government also suspended e-visa facility for Canadian citizens and said they won't be allowed to apply for Indian visa even from third countries. With Canada yet to provide any evidence or even information linking India to the killing, the Centre called Trudeau’s allegations ``politically motivated’’ and marked by prejudice as Canada had expelled an Indian diplomat only on the basis of allegations. 'Take action': India gives list of 20 Khalistan ultras to Canada While India has asked Canada to reduce its staff strength, and the details are still being worked out, whether the government formally downgrades diplomatic ties will likely depend on how Canada reacts to the move. MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India was ready to look into any specific piece of evidence or information from Canada, but so far nothing had been shared. India also called upon Canada to act on a list of more than 20 Khalistan terrorists it has shared with Canadian authorities several times in the past.``We have provided very specific information to Canada but it has not been acted upon. We have shared the same list many times in the past too,’’ said Bagchi, adding that it’s Canada that needs to worry about any reputational harm as terrorism is being funded and supported and safe haven provided there. ``Canada’s reputation as a safe haven for terrorism and extremism is growing,’’ said the Indian official, adding that Canada’s inaction against such forces had forced India to stall visa operations. He said the main issue between the 2 countries was terrorism and called upon Canada to act against pro-Khalistan forces. While the US and Australia have said that they engaged India on Trudeau’s allegations, the Indian government is also in touch with close partners over the issue.The last time India was involved in a diplomatic row of such intensity with a Western country was in 2013-14 with the US in the Devyani Khobragade case but India had then not asked the Americans to reduce the strength of their diplomatic missions here. In fact, in recent memory, India has only asked Pakistan to do so, in 2020, because of the involvement of Pakistani diplomats in, as India had then said, terrorist activities. On this occasion too, the government said Canada had been asked to cut staff strength because of their participation in anti-India activities. The Canadian high commission also said it's looking to ``adjust'' staff presence in India but added it was because of the threats faced by Canadian diplomats in India. Canada, however, said its high commission and consulates remained functional and were serving clients. ``In light of the current environment where tensions have heightened, we are taking action to ensure the safety of our diplomats. With some diplomats having received threats on various social media platforms, Global Affairs Canada is assessing its staff complement in India. As a result, and out of an abundance of caution, we have decided to temporarily adjust staff presence in India,’’ said the Canadian high commission, adding that it expected India to provide for the security of diplomats and consular officers in India in line with the Vienna conventions.\",\n",

       " \"NEW DELHI: Scrapping nearly 300 awards by various science departments through rationalisation to bring uniformity, the Centre has come out with a new set of national awards in the field of science, technology and innovation known as “Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar’’ which is to be given annually on August 23 - national space day - possibly by the President of India in a move to give them the stature of Padma awards or other national awards.Unlike existing awards, these national science awards will not have any cash component like Padma awards. All the awards will carry a citation (Sanad) and a medal each as one of the highest recognitions in the field of science, technology, and innovation in India. A total of 56 awards will be given in four categories covering 13 domains of science namely physics, chemistry, biological sciences, mathematics, computer science, earth science, medicine, engineering, agricultural science, environmental science, technology innovation, atomic energy and space science.Sharing details of the awards, the science technology ministry on Thursday said the representation from each domain/ field and “gender parity” will be ensured while deciding these awards. Earlier, only seven domains were considered for the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar awards, given by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research since 1958. The domains have now expanded to include agricultural science, environmental science, technology innovation, atomic energy, space science and computer science.“These new national awards are a transformative step in recognising achievements of the scientific community at the highest level by the government of India. With transparency and fairness in the entire selection process, work done by all sections of scientific innovators and technologists will be awarded, providing at par status with other national awards,” said the ministry in a statement.Scientists, technologists, and innovators of Indian origin abroad with exceptional contributions benefitting the Indian communities or society at large, and scientists working in private organisations will also be eligible for the awards.“It’s an attempt to rationalise the awards and raise their stature. We will try to get the awards to be given by the President every year, like what we see in the case of Padma awards. Attempts have also been made to bring uniformity in terms of dates of nominations, announcement and actual award giving ceremony,” Akhilesh Gupta, senior adviser at the department of science technology (DST) and secretary, SERB, told TOI.The nominations for this bouquet of awards will be invited every year on January 14 which would remain open till February 28 (National Science Day).

       " 'The annual session of the General Assembly is one of the most important events of the United Nations. A number of heads of state and government take the dais to put forward their ideas at the international forum. However, this year\\'s UNGA session is marked by absence of many important leaders. Except US President Joe Biden, the other four permanent Security Council leaders - namely Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Emmanuel Macron and Rishi Sunak- will not be attending the UNGA session. Then prominent leaders from several major nations including Indian PM Modi will be sending representatives to attend the session.Nevertheless, the annual UNGA session represents the most important gathering of high-profile diplomats and officials in New York. Apart from attending sessions and seminars, these diplomats use the occasion to indulge in some fun and frolic in the night.According to a report in the New York Post, \"diplomats in town for the UN General Assembly are meeting world leaders by day and high-end hookers by night\".High-priced escorts are flocking to the city from as far away as Las Vegas and Europe to meet the increased demand during the diplomatic meetings, the NY Post reported quoting sources.One source familiar with these activities mentioned that business surges by 20% to 25% during this time, creating what some describe as a \"hooker convention.\" Escorts are said to earn between $3,000 to $5,000 per session, with diplomats from various countries seeking their services while in New York.The sources suggest that diplomats, often feeling repressed in their home countries, indulge in such activities during their time in New York. However, many choose to visit hotels rather than strip clubs or public venues to avoid drawing attention. High-end escorts are in high demand due to the discretion they offer.While some diplomats do visit strip clubs, they are said to reserve private rooms, where they can spend substantial amounts of money, ranging from $50,000 to $100,000 in a single night. These activities often occur in the Midtown area of New York, known for its discreet high-end escort services, the report said.The sources also note that politicians and diplomats prefer to remain low-key and avoid any activities that could be used against them in the future.',\n",
       " 'Gangster-turned-terrorist Sukhdool Singh alias Sukha Duneke - a close associate of the slain terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar - was allegedly shot dead by unidentified gunmen in Canada Wednesday, amidst a tense stand-off between the two countries. Reports suggest that Duneke, who was from Moga in Punjab, was shot at least nine times from point blank range by his rivals in Winnipeg city.Also See: India Canada News LiveDuneke was on the National Investigation Agency\\'s most wanted list, last released on Wednesday, after he fled to Canada on a fake passport in 2017. He was among the members of the Canada-linked terror-gangster network. Lawrence Bishnoi says shooters confronted Sukha Duneke about his friends\\' murdersSukhdool Singh alias Sukha Duneke, who was gunned down in Winnipeg Wednesday, was a key member of the \\'Bambiha Gang\\' in Punjab but later joined hands with designated terrorist Arsh Dalla to work with Nijjar, the chief of KTF. The duo soared high on the notoriety chart last year when they hired two criminals to kill a Hindu man in Delhi. In a statement, Canadian Police said, \"On September 20, at approximately 10am, the Winnipeg Police Service responded to an incident in the North Inkster Industrial area. North district general patrol officers, assisted by the tactical support team, attended a residence in Hazelton Drive, where they located a deceased adult male victim. The victim was transported to hospital, where an autopsy is pending. No arrests have been made.\"Jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who owned up to Sukha\\'s killing, claimed before the killing that his shooters confronted him regarding murders of Gurlal Brar (the brother of gangster Goldy Brar), Akali Dal leader Vicky Middukhera, friends of Bishnoi since their days in Panjab University, and Kabaddi player Sandeep Nangal, a childhood friend, and then pumped bullets into his head. Duneke\\'s mother and sister are said to be in Canada and his uncle lives in their hometown in Moga, Punjab.An intelligence dossier on Duneke lists Armenia-based gangster Lucky Patial and Malaysia-based gangster Jackpal Singh as his close aides. \"The gangster was managing the activities of the gang from foreign soil and was also involved in running an extortion racket, targeted killings of rival gang members in Punjab and neighbouring areas through his local contacts and managing the network of his foreign-based associates. The accused is involved in at least 18 cases including those for murder, attempt to murder, extortion and robbery,\" the dossier reads. \"The accused was working with Arsh Dalla to resurrect Khalistan Movement after the death of another terrorist Hardeep Nijjar,\" it adds.',\n",
       " 'CHANDIGARH: Punjab’s leader of opposition Partap Singh Bajwa of the Congress on Thursday ridiculed the statewide manhunt for the associates of Canada-based wanted gangster and Sidhu Moose Wala murder prime suspect Goldy Brar as a \"publicity stunt\".Muktsar native Brar had arrived in Canada on a student visa in 2017 and now the history-sheeter is on counter-terrorism force National Investigating Agency’s list of most-wanted foreign-based gangsters. Bajwa asked chief minister Bhagwant Mann to clarify the actions his government had taken, so far, to make Canada extradite Brar. He recalled Mann’s false claim from Aam Aadmi Party’s Ahmedabad campaign last year that the US had detained Brar for the Punjab cops to take him to India.Doubting the state government\\'s intent, the LoP said that when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had toured India in 2018, former CM Captain Amarinder Singh had handed him a list of most wanted Canada residents, but in contrast, Mann had made no similar effort during Trudeau\\'s latest visit to Delhi for the G20 summit. Bajwa advised Mann to be proactive before the situation worsens.',\n",
       " \"It is undeniable that iPhones are cheaper abroad. However, does it make sense to buy all iPhone models from abroad? Is there a financial advantage to doing so? The answer is both yes and no, and it depends on the iPhone model you are buying. But before we get into that, let's take a look at the pricing of the iPhone 15 models in India.Apple iPhone 15 series India pricingApple iPhone 15: Starts at Rs 79,900Apple iPhone 15 Plus: Starts at Rs 89,900Apple iPhone 15 Pro: Starts at Rs 1,34,900Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max: Starts at Rs 1,59,900Now, the price difference between Pro models is more and you can save up to Rs 60,000 when buying them from abroad. It depends upon the country you are buying the iPhone from. Buying iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus from abroad: Price difference On one hand, you can save a lot with iPhone 15 Pro models, but the price difference between the non-Pro models -- iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus -- is not that much and buying it from abroad won’t be a really good idea. Let us explain:Before that let’s take a look at how much the non-Pro models cost in Dubai, the US and Singapore.Apple iPhone 15 series US pricingApple iPhone 15: Starts at $799 (approximately Rs 66,315)Apple iPhone 15 Plus: Starts at $899 (approximately Rs 74,654)Apple iPhone 15 series Dubai pricingApple iPhone 15: Starts at AED 3,399 (approximately Rs 76,946)Apple iPhone 15 Plus: Starts at AED 3,799 (approximately Rs 86,001)Apple iPhone 15 series Singapore pricingApple iPhone 15: Starts at S$1,299 (approximately Rs 79,217)Apple iPhone 15 Plus: Starts at S$1,449 (approximately Rs 88,448)How much you’ll actually saveWhen buying the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus from the US, the price difference is around Rs 13,000 and Rs 15,246. At first glance, the price difference seems to be big. However, considering Apple is offering an additional discount of Rs 5,000 on non-Pro models in India on HDFC cards, the price difference reduces to Rs 9,000 and Rs 10,000 which is still decent but not as much. Things become even more interesting when buying them from Dubai and Singapore. First up, the price difference is not much. It’s somewhere around Rs 3,000 for Dubai and almost similar to Singapore. In fact, you can get these two phones cheaper here in India including a bank discount of Rs 5,000. One more caseIf you’ll notice the price history of the newer iPhone models, they are often found selling at a much lower price after a couple of months of the launch or let’s say around the Diwali sale. Last year, the iPhone 14 was available for purchase at Rs 67,000 including the additional bank discount. It is expected that the iPhone 15 will also be selling at a relatively more affordable price after a couple of months. This makes the case of buying the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus from the US a lot less beneficial.\",\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: Pitching for reformative approach to justice and change of the government\\'s mindset to allow remission plea of convicts, the Supreme Court on Thursday said a person convicted of heinous offence should not be condemned to die in jail and should be released after spending a long period behind bars if his conduct has been good, reports Amit Anand Choudhary. A bench of Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Dipankar Datta came to the rescue of a convict who spent 26 years in jail in a murder case but his remission pleas were repeatedly rejected by the Kerala government over the years. SC: Remission denial signifies society\\'s resolve to be harsh The bench directed release of the convict who is now 65 years\\' old.Justice Bhat, who penned the verdict, said that not granting relief to such convicts is a reflection of unforgiving nature of society which should change. \"Excluding the relief of premature release to prisoners who have served extremely long periods of incarceration not only crushes their spirit and instils despair but signifies society\\'s resolve to be harsh and unforgiving. The idea of rewarding the prisoner for good conduct is entirely negated,\" he said.The convict was sentenced to life imprisonment for killing a woman and he has been in jail since 1989. His remission plea was considered by Advisory Board nine times and on three of such occasions, the Board recommended his premature release. However, the state government rejected his request for pre-mature release every time.Finding fault with the state government\\'s decision, the court quashed the order. The court said that referring the case back to the state for re-consideration would further prolong his incarceration and directed his release from jail.\"Regardless of the morality of continued punishment, one may question its rationality. The question is, what is achieved by continuing to punish a person who recognises the wrongness of what they\\'ve done, no longer identifies with it, and bears little resemblance to the person he was years earlier,\" the bench said.In its verdict passed last month, the apex court had held that a government should not be guided only by the severity of offence or opinion of the trial court or police for deciding remission plea of a convict.While deciding a plea filed by a convict who spent 24 years in jail in a triple murder case and whose remission plea was rejected on the ground of negative opinion from trial judge, the court said the decision on remission should not be taken on the basis of same judicial record. It added that the remission policy should be guided by \"reformative\" rather than \"retributive\" concept of justice.',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: Delhi lieutenant governor V K Saxena inaugurated a groundbreaking online portal on Thursday, allowing individuals to report instances of corruption involving government employees, according to officials at Raj Niwas. The new platform, called the Vigilance Complaint Information Management System (VCIMS), is the first of its kind in India. It aims to expedite the handling of corruption complaints while ensuring transparency and confidentiality.During the launch, LG Saxena emphasized that VCIMS would function as a centralized portal, enabling citizens to file vigilance complaints against employees of various Delhi government departments, including MCD, NDMC, DDA, and Delhi Police. The system also aims to discourage frivolous complaints and attempts at blackmail.Saxena stated, \"I hope that this first-of-its-kind initiative in the country will prove to be an effective tool to achieve the goal of zero tolerance to corruption by ensuring faceless interface between the government and the general public, who avails government services.\"Officials clarified that physical complaints related to corruption would not be accepted or acted upon, as VCIMS offers a simplified and efficient method for lodging such complaints online. This system will facilitate quicker processing and timely action against corrupt government officials.Importantly, VCIMS ensures the confidentiality of the complainant\\'s identity, which may only be disclosed in exceptional circumstances with the approval of the competent authority. The portal is expected to act as a significant deterrent, reducing opportunities for manipulation and managing complainants. It will also enhance complainants\\' awareness of their legal liability for making false, frivolous, or vexatious complaints, potentially leading to prosecution under section 182 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).To maintain the authenticity of complaints, individuals must complete a one-time registration on the platform, using their mobile number along with either Aadhaar, PAN, or Election ID number. Complainants will receive updates on their complaint\\'s status via SMS on their registered mobile number.Before the portal\\'s launch, two training sessions were conducted for the heads of various Delhi government departments. VCIMS is expected to streamline the process of reporting corruption, contributing to enhanced accountability and transparency in government services.(With inputs from PTI)',\n",
       " 'NOIDA:Italy ranks 30 in the latest ICC T20 rankings, but Francesco Bagnaia knows how to play a mean backfoot drive. Before he sets the clock on fire when he blazes down the race track of the Buddh International Circuit (BIC) this weekend for the inaugural edition of MotoGP Bharat, the defending champion and current world championship leader showed off another dimension to his timing – deft and exquisite – with a cricket bat in hand. The bowler was former India cricketer Suresh Raina, the pitch hard asphalt and the wickets a set of plastic stumps in a short ‘gully cricket’ experience that introduced the world’s elite pack of bike racers to India. “I am very competitive, but it was really fun. In India, cricket is THE sport and it was a lovely experience for us,” Bagnaia said.Altogether different innings for MotoGP elites in NoidaF abio Quartararo, Luca Marini and Pol Espargaro also got a chance to test out their cricketing skills. Not quite the adrenaline rush they are used to, and perhaps why Quartararo and Marini looked awkward both with bat and ball. Unlike Bagnaia, it was clear Marini wouldn’t come close to making it to the Italian cricket team. And Quartararo, a Frenchman, may consider brushing up his cricketing skills should he want to lift France from 52 in the ICC T20 rankings. “I took a close look at the track and it looked beautiful. Good I didn’t damage it with the bat!” joked Quartararo, summing up the sunny mood among the racers as India hosts its first elite GP for the first time in a decade since Formula One packed up. Indian rider Kadai Yaseen Ahamed, who will be participating in the Moto3 class over the weekend, also joined the top riders and gave his share of wisdom to the cricketing newbies. In the morning, another group of riders got a taste of Indian culture when they participated in a flash mob on the track. Marco Bezzecchi, Jack Miller, Aleix Espargaro, Jorge Martin and Alex Marquez were joined by 30 local dancers as the group danced to the tunes of the Oscar-winning song ‘Naatu Naatu’ and some other popular foot-tapping tracks. After their performance, Alex, the younger brother of six-time premier class world champion Marc Marquez, quipped, “I know this song. It won the Oscar. I love it.” “I am really happy to come to India, and excited for the race,” he added. The curly-haired Bezzecchi was effervescent during and after the dance. “It was a fantastic experience. I loved doing that leg shuffle when ‘Naatu Naatu’ was being played,” Bezzecchi said. “It was a great show of India’s ethos and culture,” Miller added.',\n",

They advised students interested in Canadian colleges to consider planning their academic session for next fall/autumn, which is August 2024.Also See: India Canada News Live\"With just three months left for students to travel for the spring batch, there is apprehension that visa processing times may pose challenges,\" said a representative on Thursday. Several of them indicated that they might wait for a week or so to assess the situation before deciding whether to issue admission letters for spring or for fall 2024. \"We have been counselling students and telling them not to leave for Canada immediately,\" said the representative of a university in Vancouver, underscoring the potential delays in securing study permits. Will wait another week before finalising admission plans, says Ontario university Given the daily reports of political developments, a representative from an Ontario university said the institution would wait another week before finalising plans. Depending on the on-ground situation, they would decide whether to issue admission letters for January, May, or for fall 2024, ensuring that students do not have to defer admissions due to visa delays. Some participants noted a lower turnout at the education fair compared to previous years, which they interpreted as a potential fallout of bilateral tensions.

       " 'BENGALURU: India’s move to suspend visa services to Canadian citizens amid a diplomatic row is likely to have triggered concerns among technology companies, professionals and entrepreneurs.While potential new contracts could get delayed, the impact on projects that Indian IT companies are already implementing there may be limited, since Canada has not halted visa applications by Indians to Canada.If Canada were to also stop visa applications, the implications could be more significant. On the whole though, considering the world learnt to work without travel during the Covid pandemic, visa restrictions are unlikely to severely handicap business in the short term.Vikram Shroff, head of HR Law at Nishith Desai Associates, said the Indian government’s decision implies that investors, entrepreneurs, and techies who are Canadian citizens may not be able to get visas to travel to India. \"Technology talent mobility would be adversely affected between the two countries,” he said. Shroff said the decision does not affect those Canadian citizens who have an existing Indian visa or OCI card. “It also does not affect Indian citizens to continue to travel to Canada including for family, business, or education purposes,” he noted.More than 600 Canadian companies have a presence in India and over 1,000 Canadian companies are pursuing business interests in India. Indian IT companies have a sizable exposure to outsourcing work from Canadian companies. Earlier, this year, Montreal-based Bombardier roped in TCS to modernise the former’s legacy systems that support its engineering, manufacturing, aftermarket services and defence activities. Last year, TCS became the new title sponsor of the TCS Toronto Waterfront Marathon that includes developing a race app in partnership with Canada Running Series (CRS) to provide an integrated digital experience. Infosys has committed to hire 8,000 Canadians by 2024 and it’s well past the halfway mark. Wipro has a big contractual relationship with Canadian energy utilities company Atco to provide outsourcing solutions.Indian IT firms have centres in Mississauga, Ontario, Montreal, Quebec, and Waterloo, all of which are premier tech talent hotspots. Canadian fund houses have invested in India\\'s startup ecosystem. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), for instance, has invested at least Rs 1.7 lakh crore in India. It has investments in companies including Nykaa, Acko, Byju\\'s and Zomato. Canadian fund Ontario Teachers has invested more than $3 billion in India.Cyrus D Mehta, managing partner of New York-based law firm Cyrus D Mehta Partners, said, “Although India has suspended visas for Canadians, it would not be wise for Canada to block visas for Indian nationals. While countries can engage in tit for tat retaliation with diplomats, it should not extend such tit for tat to visa policy. Keeping the immigration channels open helps to diffuse tensions and improve understanding among the people of both countries.”India’s apex tech body Nasscom said it is in close touch with its members in Canada and as per their feedback there are no immediate areas of concern. \"Since this is an evolving situation, we will continue to engage with stakeholders to track any potential areas of impact that may need support,” it said.',\n",
       " 'TORONTO: The allegation of India’s involvement in the killing of a Sikh Canadian is based on human and surveillance intelligence, including signals intelligence of Indian diplomats in Canada, an official familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Thursday.The official said that the communications involved Indian officials and Indian diplomats in Canada and that some of the intelligence was provided by a member of the “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance — US, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, did not say which ally provided the intelligence or give any specific details of what was contained in the intelligence.The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation first reported details of the intelligence.Earlier Thursday, India told Canada to reduce its diplomatic staff and stopped issuing visas to Canadian citizens as a rift widened between the once-close allies over Ottawa’s allegation that New Delhi may have been involved in the killing of the Canadian citizen.Ties between the two countries — key strategic partners in security and trade — have plunged to their lowest point in years since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were “credible allegations” of Indian involvement in the assassination of the Sikh separatist activist in June in a Vancouver suburb.Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a 45-year-old Canadian citizen who had been wanted by India for years, was gunned down outside the temple he led in the city of Surrey. Nijjar, a plumber, was born in India but became a Canadian citizen in 2007.Speaking on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, Trudeau acknowledged the complicated diplomatic situation he faced.“There is no question that India is a country of growing importance and a country that we need to continue to work with,\" he said. “We are not looking to provoke or cause problems but we are unequivocal around the importance of the rule of law and unequivocal about the importance of protecting Canadians.”The bombshell Monday allegation by Trudeau set off an international tit-for-tat, with each country expelling a diplomat. India called the allegations “absurd.”Canada has yet to provide any public evidence to back Trudeau\\'s allegations, and Canada\\'s U.N. ambassador, Bob Rae ,indicated Thursday that it might not come very soon. “This is very early days,” Rae told reporters at the United Nations, insisting that while facts will emerge, they must “come out in the course of the pursuit of justice.”\"That’s what we call the rule of law in Canada,” he said.On Thursday, the company that processes Indian visas in Canada announced that visa services had been suspended until further notice. The BLS Indian Visa Application Center gave no further details.The suspension means Canadians who don’t already have visas will not be able to travel to India until services resume. Canadians are among the top travelers to India. In 2021, 80,000 Canadian tourists visited the country, according to India’s Bureau of Immigration.Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi blamed the visa suspension, which includes visas issued in third countries, on safety issues.“Security threats being faced by our High Commission and consulates in Canada have disrupted their normal functioning. Accordingly, they are temporarily unable to process visa applications,” Bagchi told reporters. \"We will be reviewing the situation on a regular basis.\"He gave no details on the alleged threats.The announcement quickly rippled across Canada, especially among people with ties to India.Sukhwinder Dhillon, a 56-year-old grocery store owner in Montreal, said he had a trip planned to his birthplace in India to see family and sort out his deceased father’s estate. Dhillon, who came to Canada in 1998, said he makes the trip back every two or three years, and he has lost two people in his immediate family since he was last home.“My father passed, and my brother passed,” Dhillon said. “I want to go now ... Now I don’t know when we’ll go.”Bagchi, the Indian foreign ministry spokesman, also called for a reduction in Canadian diplomats in India, saying they outnumbered Indian diplomats in Canada.“We have informed the Canadian government that there should be parity\" in staffing, he said.The Canadian High Commission in New Delhi said Thursday that all its consulates in India are open and continue to serve clients. It said some of its diplomats had received threats on social media, prompting it to assess its “staff complement in India.” It added that Canada expects India to provide security for its diplomats and consular officers working there.On Wednesday, India warned its citizens to be careful when traveling to Canada because of “growing anti-India activities and politically condoned hate-crimes.”Canada has yet to provide any evidence of Indian involvement in the killing. India\\'s security and intelligence branches have long been active in South Asia and are suspected in a number of killings in Pakistan. But arranging the killing of a Canadian citizen in Canada, home to nearly 2 million people of Indian descent, would be unprecedented.Bagchi accused Canada of providing a safe haven for terrorists. He said India has regularly provided Canada with specific evidence about criminal activities by people based on its soil, but the information has not been acted upon.India has criticized Canada for years over giving free rein to Sikh separatists, including Nijjar. New Delhi had accused him of having links to terrorism, which he denied.Nijjar was a local leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland, known as Khalistan. A bloody decadelong Sikh insurgency shook north India in the 1970s and 1980s until it was crushed in a government crackdown in which thousands of people were killed, including prominent Sikh leaders.While the active insurgency ended decades ago, the Indian government has warned that Sikh separatists are trying to stage a comeback and pressed countries like Canada, where Sikhs comprise over 2% of the population, to do more in stopping them.At the time of his killing, Nijjar was working to organize an unofficial Sikh diaspora referendum on independence from India.New Delhi’s anxieties about Sikh separatist groups in Canada have long been a strain on the relationship, but the two have maintained strong defense and trade ties and share strategic interests over China’s global ambitions.In March, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government summoned the Canadian high commissioner in New Delhi, its top diplomat in the country, to complain about Sikh independence protests in Canada.But signs of a broader diplomatic rift emerged at the summit of the Group of 20 leading world economies hosted by India earlier this month. Trudeau had frosty encounters with Modi, and a few days later Canada canceled a trade mission to India planned for the fall. A trade deal between the two is now on pause.On Wednesday, India’s National Investigation Agency said it has intensified its crackdown on Sikh insurgents operating in India.It announced rewards of up to 1 million rupees ($12,000) for information leading to the arrest of five insurgents, one of whom is believed to be based in neighboring Pakistan.The agency accused them of extorting money from businesses for a banned Sikh organization, the Babbar Khalsa International, and of targeted killings in India. “They also have established a network of operatives in various countries to further their terrorist activities in India,” it said in a statement, without naming any country.India accuses Pakistan of supporting insurgencies in Kashmir and Punjab, charges that Islamabad denies.',\n",

The chargesheet named Verma, one Dr Luv Gupta and absconding Dr Akhilesh Pal. The case came to light in July 2022 and Verma was arrested in July this year.The chargesheet said Dr Verma called the Shahapur-based victim and her father, Manohar Patole, to his cabin in Sion Hospital premises and assured them of admission under the dean\\'s quota. They paid Verma Rs 20 lakh at that time and another Rs 45 lakh when Verma\\'s accomplice, Luv Gupta, made the victim fill the admission form and emailed him an allotment letter on the dean\\'s letterhead regarding the admission. Police have also filed a chargesheet against Sahiba Shaikh whose bank account was used by Verma to transfer a few lakhs. Sahiba has procured anticipatory bail from Bombay high court on the grounds that she has no role in the alleged scam. The chargesheet is the first against Verma in the court. Police have attached the statements of various banks in which the money was transferred.There are 13 offences of cheating registered against Verma and his accomplices.Last year, the home department had formed a special investigation ieam (SIT) of the crime branch to probe the MBBS admission racket.The chargesheet is based on the complaint filed by Patole who alleged he was looking for MBBS admission for his daughter. While searching for a seat under the management quota in November 2020, Patole came across Verma whom he met in Sion Hospital. Gupta and Pal were also present.Gupta demanded Rs 1 crore for a seat at Somaiya Medical College in Sion and Rs 80 lakh for one at Sion medical college.

The letter of permission for starting new medical colleges after 2023-24 shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/ I00/ 150 MBBS seats, the notification said. Colleges seeking an increase in the number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS students from the year 2024-25. The commission has, however, exempted applicants, who have already sent applications seeking an increase in MBBS seats.Second, it says medical colleges shall follow the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for l0 lakh population in that state or UT. This means Tamil Nadu, which has more than 10,000 seats in more than 70 medical colleges, cannot apply for more colleges. The state has a population of about a little over 8 crore.The notification does not offer justification for the decision, but senior doctors in the NMC said the decision was made to ensure resources are spent judiciously to ensure uniform distribution of doctors across the country. \"TN has more than 1.8 lakh doctors registered in Tamil Nadu and among them, 1.5 lakh are still practicing.

In 2001, when the case came up for hearing, police escorted them to the additional district and sessions court, Poonamallee, where they attacked the cops and escaped. Chinna Mari was killed in a police encounter and Peter was arrested. Binu, however, vanished.Poonamallee police had formed special teams to trace him, but they had no luck.

       " 'Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has tried to deflect attention away from his cosy political ties to radicals and his government’s indulgence of violence-espousing Khalistanis by seeking to put India in the dock with an astounding allegation. Trudeau’s evidence-free claim should not obscure a larger problem confronting India – the five Anglosphere countries’ sheltering of Khalistani extremists that endorse violence as a legitimate tool to achieve Khalistan.The Khalistan idea has few takers among Sikhs in India, as the highly regarded, Washington-based Pew Research Centre highlighted in a poll released in 2021. The survey found that 95% of Sikhs are “very proud to be Indians”. In fact, 70% of Sikhs believe “a person who disrespects India cannot be a Sikh”. Even in Canada and other English-speaking countries, Khalistan supporters make up just a fraction of the Sikh diaspora.Yet, an unholy combination of two factors is keeping Khalistan militancy alive overseas. The first is Pakistan’s funding, support and possible training of Khalistanis in a bid to destabilise India, as a Hudson Institute report brought out.More surprising is the role of Canada, UK, US, Australia and, marginally, New Zealand, as if no lesson has been learnt from the 1985 bombing by Khalistani extremists of an Air India flight from Toronto that killed all 329 people on board. These countries continue to look the other way as Khalistani radicals step up their militancy from Western soil, including issuing death threats and calls to violence. The inaction has emboldened the extremists to vandalise Indian diplomatic missions and Hindu temples, and threaten Indian diplomats.Long before Trudeau’s allegation plunged Indo-Canadian ties to their lowest ebb, New Delhi was urging the Anglosphere countries to rein in the rising tide of Khalistani militancy directed at India. Instead, what India got were nasty surprises – from militants storming the Indian high commission in London and dual attacks on the Indian consulate in San Francisco to an anti-India parade in Canada seeking to immortalise former PM Indira Gandhi’s assassins.Khalistani militancy is particularly acute in Canada, which explains why its British Columbia province has become the global hub of the Khalistan movement. With India’s patience wearing thin, PM Narendra Modi, in a frosty meeting with Trudeau during the G20 summit, gave him a dressing-down for being soft on Khalistani terrorists.To keep his minority government afloat, Trudeau depends on support from the New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh, a Khalistan sympathiser. With the tail wagging the dog, Trudeau has pandered to hardline Canadian Sikhs. Take just this example: Trudeau cheered on Indian farmers blockading highways near New Delhi and then later, in the style of an autocrat, declared a national emergency in Canada and crushed peaceful protests against his Covid vaccination policy, calling their blockades a security threat akin to terrorism.Yet, Trudeau refuses to act against the real terrorists in Canada that threaten Indian security. Harbouring violent extremists also threatens Canadian and international security because a day may come when Canadian Khalistani militants carry out a major terrorist strike within Canada or in another Western country.Canada’s record of shielding Khalistani terrorists is a case of “like father, like son”. Trudeau’s father, former PM Pierre Trudeau, turned down Indira Gandhi’s 1982 request for extradition of Babbar Khalsa chief Talwinder Parmar who, according to Canada’s official probe, went on to become the mastermind of the Air India flight bombing. Today, the growing nexus between Khalistani extremists and criminal bands in British Columbia has spawned gangland killings.In this light, Trudeau’s allegation against India clearly seems a diversionary tactic to help obscure sordid facts, including the continued cover he is giving to operations of Khalistani militants in the name of free speech. His allegation is based not on any police-collected evidence but on purported inputs from the murky world of espionage. In spy games, geopolitics often trumps facts.India should not allow Trudeau to deflect attention from Canada’s answerability on becoming a safe haven for militants promoting or glorifying terrorism. Canada cannot cite free speech law to defend inaction because it has other laws against hate or incitement to violence that ought to be invoked. Without curbing its Khalistani militancy, Canada could undermine its internal security, becoming one day the Pakistan of the West.Indian diplomacy must also exert sustained pressure on the other Anglosphere countries to stop countenancing the rising anti-India activities of extremist Khalistani groups operating from their territories. The paradox is that even as a tilt towards the West is becoming apparent in Indian foreign policy, the Anglosphere countries seem to be looking at the violent Khalistani extremists they shelter as potential leverage against India. Mutual respect and mutual security are indispensable to an informal alliance between the West and India.For starters, Canada and India must arrest the downward spiral in their relations through quiet diplomacy. With no significant conflict of strategic interest, these two major democracies ought to be close partners. Trudeau can secure India’s cooperation on the murder probe if he is willing to clean up his act at home – in Canada’s own long-term interest.The writer is a geostrategist',\n",
       " 'MUMBAI: In one of the most sensational medical admission scams in recent times, the deputy dean of civic-run LTMG Hospital in Sion called victims to his cabin promising them of \"sure admission under the dean\\'s quota\" and demanded the first instalment of up to Rs 20 lakh.This modus operandi adopted by Dr Rakesh Verma, now suspended from service, is part of the 369-page chargesheet filed by Sion police before Kurla metropolitan magistrate court on Thursday. The chargesheet named Verma, one Dr Luv Gupta and absconding Dr Akhilesh Pal. The case came to light in July 2022 and Verma was arrested in July this year.The chargesheet said Dr Verma called the Shahapur-based victim and her father, Manohar Patole, to his cabin in Sion Hospital premises and assured them of admission under the dean\\'s quota. They paid Verma Rs 20 lakh at that time and another Rs 45 lakh when Verma\\'s accomplice, Luv Gupta, made the victim fill the admission form and emailed him an allotment letter on the dean\\'s letterhead regarding the admission. Police have also filed a chargesheet against Sahiba Shaikh whose bank account was used by Verma to transfer a few lakhs. Sahiba has procured anticipatory bail from Bombay high court on the grounds that she has no role in the alleged scam. The chargesheet is the first against Verma in the court. Police have attached the statements of various banks in which the money was transferred.There are 13 offences of cheating registered against Verma and his accomplices.Last year, the home department had formed a special investigation ieam (SIT) of the crime branch to probe the MBBS admission racket.The chargesheet is based on the complaint filed by Patole who alleged he was looking for MBBS admission for his daughter. While searching for a seat under the management quota in November 2020, Patole came across Verma whom he met in Sion Hospital. Gupta and Pal were also present.Gupta demanded Rs 1 crore for a seat at Somaiya Medical College in Sion and Rs 80 lakh for one at Sion medical college. The accused even sent an e-mail using the dean\\'s ID to the complainant confirming the admission, the officer said.\"From January 2021 to April 2021, the girl attended online classes for MBBS first year. Gupta then started demanding the remaining Rs 45 lakh, but Patole asked him to wait till regular classes began,\\'\\' said the chargesheet. Later, the complainant learnt an offence was registered against Verma who was suspended; the authorities received a few complaints of irregularities in the hospital. One Alisha Shaikh from Madhya Pradesh who completed her MBBS was looking for post-graduation when she met a tout who on behalf of Verma demanded Rs 1.5 crore, of which her father paid Rs 29 lakh. She was upset to learn that Verma was suspended. Investigating officer, assistant inspector Santosh Tagad, and senior inspector Manisha Shirke confirmed the chargesheet was filed in the case.',\n",

Before he sets the clock on fire when he blazes down the race track of the Buddh International Circuit (BIC) this weekend for the inaugural edition of MotoGP Bharat, the defending champion and current world championship leader showed off another dimension to his timing – deft and exquisite – with a cricket bat in hand. The bowler was former India cricketer Suresh Raina, the pitch hard asphalt and the wickets a set of plastic stumps in a short ‘gully cricket’ experience that introduced the world’s elite pack of bike racers to India. “I am very competitive, but it was really fun. In India, cricket is THE sport and it was a lovely experience for us,” Bagnaia said.Altogether different innings for MotoGP elites in NoidaF abio Quartararo, Luca Marini and Pol Espargaro also got a chance to test out their cricketing skills. Not quite the adrenaline rush they are used to, and perhaps why Quartararo and Marini looked awkward both with bat and ball. Unlike Bagnaia, it was clear Marini wouldn’t come close to making it to the Italian cricket team. And Quartararo, a Frenchman, may consider brushing up his cricketing skills should he want to lift France from 52 in the ICC T20 rankings. “I took a close look at the track and it looked beautiful.

I love it.” “I am really happy to come to India, and excited for the race,” he added. The curly-haired Bezzecchi was effervescent during and after the dance. “It was a fantastic experience.

The commission has, however, exempted applicants, who have already sent applications seeking an increase in MBBS seats.Second, it says medical colleges shall follow the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for l0 lakh population in that state or UT. This means Tamil Nadu, which has more than 10,000 seats in more than 70 medical colleges, cannot apply for more colleges. The state has a population of about a little over 8 crore.The notification does not offer justification for the decision, but senior doctors in the NMC said the decision was made to ensure resources are spent judiciously to ensure uniform distribution of doctors across the country. \"TN has more than 1.8 lakh doctors registered in Tamil Nadu and among them, 1.5 lakh are still practicing. The recommended ratio of doctors is only 1:1000 and we already have 1 per 600,\" said PG medical board member Dr K Senthil, also president of the TN Government Doctors\\' Association. With a fertility rate of 1.4, there is a decline in population. \"In ten years, TN will have 1 doctor for every 350 people because every year 10,000 MBBS graduates and 1,500 foreign medical graduates apply for a medical license,\" he said. The southern states must use this as an opportunity to increase post-graduate and super specialty seats, he said.However, Tamil Nadu health secretary Gagadeep Singh Bedi said the state has a policy of establishing a medical college in every district to ensure equal distribution of doctors and tertiary care facilities equally. \"Also, why should we look at Tamil Nadu data alone? The country needs more doctors. If Chennai can work well as a medical hub for the rest of India, doctors from here can work in other states too. When we have the facilities and requirements we must be permitted to start new facilities,\" he said.',\n",

She hasn’t given one in years, and now a video is going viral where she is stating the reason why she stays away from the media.In the video, Nayanthara was speaking to Asianet and gave her reasons for staying away from the media. She mentioned that the media was targeting her unnecessarily with gossip and rumours which hurt her and her family. Back then, she was also affected by wedding rumours.Nayanthara was also criticized by Malayalam audiences for appearing in glamorous roles in Tamil movies as opposed to simple but powerful roles in Malayalam. She also explained the dynamics of Tamil Cinema and understands that in films led by Rajinikanth and Ajith, she can’t play a prominent role.“Won’t my family get hurt? What did I do for my family to get hurt? What I am doing is my work. I am doing what my directors are telling me. No one can point out anything in that. Why are you doing glamorous [roles] and not doing homely [roles]. No one has the right to ask all these things. If you like it, you can watch, if you don’t like it then don’t watch. There are so many people who like to watch and who like me. You can criticize but you need to be right about things,” Nayanthara said in the interview.“You shouldn’t have done this character this way, or your acting was not to the point, these are proper criticisms. And not the ones who come and say why did you do that, etc. This is why I stopped giving interviews, and when there are controversies about me, I know when I need to clarify, and I will clarify only at that time.

       " 'I don’t know of a single person who is opposed to the idea, and future reality, of considerably greater representation of women in Parliament, and in all levels of decision making – home, office, divorce etc. The women’s reservation bill is a long overdue act in this march towards justice and equality. The first such bill was introduced in Parliament on September 12, 1996; then others in 1998, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2008 and now.The general expectation is that the bill as tabled in the new Parliament on September 19, 2023 will not be enacted until at least the 2029 election. Why? Because of Clause 5 that states the bill “shall come into effect after an exercise of delimitation is undertaken for this purpose after the relevant figures for the first census taken after commencement of the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Eighth Amendment) Act, 2023 have been published”.That will make it 33 years after the first mooting of the bill – and 2029 maybe a trifle on the optimistic side. Neither the census nor the delimitation exercise is necessary for a ‘theoretical’ passage and enactment in the bill; but Clause 5 makes it so.And there is the 84th Amendment, 2001 that froze constituency boundaries till the first census after 2026, which is expected to take place in 2031. Note that the existing total number of seats in Lok Sabha is based on the 1971 Census. This means that the delimitation exercise is likely to be contentious, at a minimum.Maybe mid-thirties for the implementation of women’s reservation? So the first bill mooted in the Bharat-India Parliament will be implemented more than a decade after being passed? It is often said, in policy-making, that let not the perfect be the enemy of the good. A perfect solution towards the achievement of the very desirable goal of equal representation of women in Parliament would be for every political party to nominate 33% (or 50%) women candidates, and 67% men, for whatever election is taking place – panchayat, municipal, assembly, Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha.This is neither utopian, nor a pipe dream. Indeed, many countries from Rwanda to Sweden have done it. In a PRS list of 12 countries, only three did not have a quota in political parties – Bangladesh, Japan and the US, and only one had a quota in Parliament, Bangladesh.The country with the highest representation of women in Parliament in the world is Rwanda, with 61% parliamentarians after the 2018 election. In 2003, Rwanda enacted a quota law with a difference – the law mandated that 30% of all elected positions will be filled by women. No restriction on how many each political party could select as candidates – zero women, 33%, 50% or even 100%. The law was – let the best person win, and 61% of the electorally best persons were women.In many parts of Europe, women have close to 50% representation in Parliament, and those days are long gone when Indira Gandhi and Golda Meir were the only two women leaders. The new women’s bill has an interesting and informative section titled, ‘Objects and Reasons’, which documents the reasons for the desired necessity of more women parliamentarians:* “True empowerment of women will require greater participation of women in the decision making process.”* “While women participate substantively in the Panchayati Raj institutions and municipal bodies, their representation in the state legislatures as well as in Parliament is still limited. Providing for higher representation of women at State and national level has also been a long pending demand. There have been several efforts to introduce women’s reservation in Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies. The last such attempt was made in 2010, when Rajya Sabha had passed a Bill for women’s reservation, but the same could not be passed in Lok Sabha.”These quotes do not indicate that PM Modi and BJP lawmakers are in a wait and see mood till the mid-2030s. Indeed, one interpretation of Modi’s extraordinary political success (every election, state and central, won with a majority of seats) is that this is because of his “concentration on development and programmes for the poor”. And in his 2016 Independence Day speech, Modi outlined why these policies have to be oriented towards women: “We are working with emphasis on empowerment of women, health of women, economic prosperity of women, physical empowerment of women.”Political empowerment of women is the next logical step. The women’s reservation bill is the first baby step. A giant woman step would be for Modi to announce that for the 2024 election, his party will nominate a large proportion (33%?) of its Lok Sabha candidates as women. Let the woman domino effect come into play.The writer is former Executive Director IMF and former member of PM Modi’s Economic Advisory Council. Views are personal',\n",

The registrations stood at 2.5 lakh last year. The test is scheduled on November 26.According to CAT 2023 convener Prof Sanjeet Singh from IIM-Lucknow, the organising institute for the test this year, there is a record increase of 30% in the applications in one year. The rise was 11% in 2022.\"The registrations are highest in history of CAT, ever since it was started in 1977. In absolute numbers, an increase of 75,000 applications, year-on-year, is a record,\" Singh told TOI.Female registrations see a 3% increase in CAT this yearThe high numbers, said experts, reflect sustained interest students have in the field of management and in IIMs. \"I believe increased publicity about CAT on social media platforms and adding more test cities with increase in exam centres, particularly in tier-II cities, have resulted in this highest-ever registrations,\" said Prof Singh. Of the total 3.3 lakh, 1.17 lakh, or 38%, are female. There has been a 3% increase in female registrations. Over the past decade, IIMs have taken multiple steps to increase gender diversity in management education. Consequently, IIMs have anywhere between 30% and 45% female students on their campuses. Till 2008, CAT was a pen and-paper test. This year, 2.9 lakh applicants had registered, which was the previous highest number of registernations. \"The first computer-based test was held in 2009,\" said Prof Singh. After this, the numbers dipped and rose gradually. While 2.41 lakh registered themselves in 2019, the number dipped in 2020 to 2.28, when the first wave of Covid-19 hit the world- .CAT 2023 will be a computer-based test of 120 minutes. The test will have the following three sections: Section I: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Section II: Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning, Section III: Quantitative Ability. Candidates will be allotted 40 minutes for answering questions in each section and they will not be allowed to switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section.

The chargesheet named Verma, one Dr Luv Gupta and absconding Dr Akhilesh Pal. The case came to light in July 2022 and Verma was arrested in July this year.The chargesheet said Dr Verma called the Shahapur-based victim and her father, Manohar Patole, to his cabin in Sion Hospital premises and assured them of admission under the dean\\'s quota. They paid Verma Rs 20 lakh at that time and another Rs 45 lakh when Verma\\'s accomplice, Luv Gupta, made the victim fill the admission form and emailed him an allotment letter on the dean\\'s letterhead regarding the admission. Police have also filed a chargesheet against Sahiba Shaikh whose bank account was used by Verma to transfer a few lakhs. Sahiba has procured anticipatory bail from Bombay high court on the grounds that she has no role in the alleged scam. The chargesheet is the first against Verma in the court. Police have attached the statements of various banks in which the money was transferred.There are 13 offences of cheating registered against Verma and his accomplices.Last year, the home department had formed a special investigation ieam (SIT) of the crime branch to probe the MBBS admission racket.The chargesheet is based on the complaint filed by Patole who alleged he was looking for MBBS admission for his daughter. While searching for a seat under the management quota in November 2020, Patole came across Verma whom he met in Sion Hospital. Gupta and Pal were also present.Gupta demanded Rs 1 crore for a seat at Somaiya Medical College in Sion and Rs 80 lakh for one at Sion medical college. The accused even sent an e-mail using the dean\\'s ID to the complainant confirming the admission, the officer said.\"From January 2021 to April 2021, the girl attended online classes for MBBS first year. Gupta then started demanding the remaining Rs 45 lakh, but Patole asked him to wait till regular classes began,\\'\\' said the chargesheet. Later, the complainant learnt an offence was registered against Verma who was suspended; the authorities received a few complaints of irregularities in the hospital. One Alisha Shaikh from Madhya Pradesh who completed her MBBS was looking for post-graduation when she met a tout who on behalf of Verma demanded Rs 1.5 crore, of which her father paid Rs 29 lakh.

       " 'NEW DELHI: Pitching for reformative approach to justice and change of the government\\'s mindset to allow remission plea of convicts, the Supreme Court on Thursday said a person convicted of heinous offence should not be condemned to die in jail and should be released after spending a long period behind bars if his conduct has been good, reports Amit Anand Choudhary. A bench of Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Dipankar Datta came to the rescue of a convict who spent 26 years in jail in a murder case but his remission pleas were repeatedly rejected by the Kerala government over the years. SC: Remission denial signifies society\\'s resolve to be harsh The bench directed release of the convict who is now 65 years\\' old.Justice Bhat, who penned the verdict, said that not granting relief to such convicts is a reflection of unforgiving nature of society which should change. \"Excluding the relief of premature release to prisoners who have served extremely long periods of incarceration not only crushes their spirit and instils despair but signifies society\\'s resolve to be harsh and unforgiving. The idea of rewarding the prisoner for good conduct is entirely negated,\" he said.The convict was sentenced to life imprisonment for killing a woman and he has been in jail since 1989. His remission plea was considered by Advisory Board nine times and on three of such occasions, the Board recommended his premature release. However, the state government rejected his request for pre-mature release every time.Finding fault with the state government\\'s decision, the court quashed the order. The court said that referring the case back to the state for re-consideration would further prolong his incarceration and directed his release from jail.\"Regardless of the morality of continued punishment, one may question its rationality. The question is, what is achieved by continuing to punish a person who recognises the wrongness of what they\\'ve done, no longer identifies with it, and bears little resemblance to the person he was years earlier,\" the bench said.In its verdict passed last month, the apex court had held that a government should not be guided only by the severity of offence or opinion of the trial court or police for deciding remission plea of a convict.While deciding a plea filed by a convict who spent 24 years in jail in a triple murder case and whose remission plea was rejected on the ground of negative opinion from trial judge, the court said the decision on remission should not be taken on the basis of same judicial record. It added that the remission policy should be guided by \"reformative\" rather than \"retributive\" concept of justice.',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON: Under pressure on world stage to produce evidence to back up its allegation that New Delhi is behind the assassination of an immigrant Sikh militant, the Canadian government has claimed in leaks to the media that it has \"both human and signals intelligence\" pointing to the involvement of Indian officials in the killing. The intelligence, which is said to also implicate Indian diplomats serving in Canada, did not come solely from Canada; some was provided by an unnamed ally in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported on Thursday night, citing unnamed government sources. Canada, US, UK, Australia, and New Zealand are members of the alliance. Signals intelligence would typically mean electronic eavesdropping; the unnamed Five Eyes ally, going by the vehemence with which Washington came out today in support of Canada, points to the United States. At a White House briefing, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Washington is consulting closely with Canada on the issue supports the efforts that they are undertaking in this investigation. The US has also been in touch with the Indian government, he added. Sullivan denied there was any \"wedge\" between the US and Canada on the issue and asserted that \"as soon as we heard from the Canadian prime minister publicly about the allegations, we went out publicly ourselves and expressed our deep concern about them, our support for a law enforcement process to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.\"\"We have deep concerns about the allegations, and we would like to see this investigation carried forward and the perpetrators held to account. That is what the United States has stood for from the moment this emerged in public, and we will continue to stand for that until this fully plays its way out,\" he added. Asked if President Biden intends to speak to PM Modi about the Canadian allegations and if the incident could drive a wedge between the US and India, Sullivan declined to get into \"private diplomatic conversations that have either already happened or are going to happen on this topic, only to say that we have been and will be in contact with the Indians at high levels on this issue.\" Sullivan\\'s national security counterpart in India is Ajit Doval.Although the US itself has carried out trans-national assassinations, including of its own citizens (notably Anwar al Awlaki, an Islamic scholar who was killed in Yemen in a Drone strike), Sullivan maintained that no country could get a free pass for such an action. \"It is a matter of concern for us. It is something we take seriously. It’s something we will keep working on, and we will do that regardless of the country. There is not some special exemption you get for actions like this. Regardless of the country, we will stand up and defend our basic principles. And we will also consult closely with allies like Canada as they pursue their law enforcement and diplomatic process,\" he said. The CBC report meanwhile cited \"Canadian sources\" saying that \"when pressed behind closed doors, no Indian official has denied the bombshell allegation at the core of this case — that there is evidence to suggest Indian government involvement in the assassination of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.\" New Delhi has said Canada has produced no evidence to back its allegations. Trudeau too has used the word allegations, not evidence, in accusing India of involvement. \"I can assure you that the decision to share these allegations on the floor of the House of Commons … was not done lightly,\" Trudeau said Thursday in New York after attending the United Nations General Assembly. \"It was done with the utmost seriousness.\"',\n",

       " \"Spots up for grabs in World Cup dress rehearsal vs AustraliaOn the face of it, the three-match ODI series between India and Australia, as Pakistan legend Wasim Akram pointed out recently, is pretty much a needless exercise. Squeezed just before the 2023 World Cup, it leaves both the teams with a potential danger of injuring their top players, or at least leaving them jaded. The first ODI at Mohali on Friday will mark the start of Team India's 'Bharat Darshan,' which will involve travelling to as many as 14 cities till November 12 - no mean task even for seasoned backpackers. However, a deeper look at things will tell you that this series does have some value for both the teams. For India, who are just fresh off the Asia Cup triumph, these games offer the best chance to find, hopefully, a final answer to the ' R Ashwin question' in white-ball cricket, which keeps popping up every few years.With left-arm spinner Axar Patel out due to a left quadriceps strain, India have gone back to their old warhorse, off-spinner, who has just turned 37. Having been put on alert since Axar's injury, Ashwin has done all the right things-trained at the NCA, bowled 10 overs in a local league game in Chennai, but nothing can replace the value of this outing - resuming his battle with the likes of Steve Smith and David Warner on featherbeds. Ashwin last played ODIs for India 18 months ago against South Africa in South Africa. Making a comeback in this format after four-and-half years, he wasn't too successful in that series, taking 1-53 in 10 overs 0-68 in 10 overs in the final two games.Previously, he was dropped in 2017 after enduring an ordinary time in the Champions Trophy in England. Still, a few factors make Ashwin's unexpected recall at this hour understandable. His rich experience - 151 wickets in 113 ODIs@33.49, the presence of dangerous left-handers in almost every opposition and the likelihood of wickets which aid spin during India's World Cup matches in the 2023 ODI World Cup - all indicate there may be a place for Ashwin after all.India have also rested their lead spinner Kuldeep Yadav, putting the focus on Ashwin. For starters, the offie would have to stave off competition from Washington Sundar. The other issue is the fitness status of Shreyas Iyer. Picked for the Asia Cup, all the middle order batsman played was two games - in the one against Pakistan, the 28-year-old scored 14, and against Nepal he didn't get to bat. Thereafter, he sat out due to back spasms for four games on a trot, certainly not a good sign for someone returning after a long layoff.With skipper Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli and even allrounder Hardik Pandya resting for the first two games, the likes of Iyer and Suryakumar Yadav, who have endured an ordinary time in the ODIs, will need to assert themselves in this series.Australia will be bolstered by the return of skipper Pat Cummins and Steve Smith from injuries.\",\n",
       " \"BATHINDA: Slain gangster-terrorist Sukhdool Singh Gill, aka Sukha Duneke, started out small in 2005, cutting his teeth in crime with petty jobs before graduating to running an extortion racket and carrying out targeted killings from Canada.Thirty-something Sukha, whose roots lie in the nondescript Duneke village of Punjab's Moga district that finds mention in his alias, spent 18 years of his life chasing notoriety before meeting a bloody end in Canada's Winnipeg on Thursday. Known to be a close associate of Arshdeep Singh, alias Arsh Dala, who hails from Dala village in Moga, Sukha was a chip off the old Bambiha gang, originally headed by Davinder Bambiha. Davinder, who was from Bathinda, was killed in an encounter on September 9, 2016, in a paddy field of Gill Kalan village in Bathinda.After Davinder's death, some of his gang members migrated abroad. Sukha, who had seven cases against his name at the time, used his clout to get his application for a second passport verified by police and left for Canada in 2017, sources said.India-Canada News live updatesIn Canada, Sukha came in contact with Arsh, who is believed to have been in touch with slain Khalistan Tiger Force head Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The NIA, in an FIR filed on June 10, 2021, under UAPA, said Arsh and other criminals had been extorting and killing in Punjab at Nijjar's behest.On August 26 last year, Sukha and a few other criminals were charged under UAPA with forming a group to recruit youth in India for criminal acts, including killings. In Canada, Sukha was named in the killing of UK-based kabaddi player Sandeep Nangal Ambian in March 2022. It is only after the murders of Ambian and rapper Sidhu Moose Wala in May that intelligence agencies started looking into records and passports of gangsters residing in foreign countries. Arsh and Sukha were found to be the prime suspects in several instances of crime.Punjab Police's anti-gangster taskforce discovered that Sukha had got a second passport issued with the connivance of some cops posted in Moga despite already having one that had been confiscated. In 2022, two cops were charged with clearing Sukha's passport application by bending rules.Moga SSP J Elenchezhian said the police were trying to get details of how Sukha entered the world of crime and his involvement in criminal activities while in Punjab and later in Canada. His mother and sister lived with him in Canada.Residents of Duneke village are reluctant to talk about Sukha and his family beyond the known facts such as the slain gangster's father being a government employee before he died. Sukha had apparently got a job in the Moga DC's office after his father's death, but he didn't last long there.\",\n",

       " 'GUWAHATI: At least 15 people were wounded in Manipur\\'s Imphal valley on Thursday as protesters clashed with security forces when they tried to storm police stations and court arrest, demanding the unconditional release of five men arrested on Saturday for impersonating policemen and carrying firearms.As a precautionary measure, the state government clamped total curfew in Imphal East and Imphal West districts. The curfew relaxation hours, which were in effect from 5am to 9pm on Thursday, were withdrawn from 5pm, and restrictions on movement were enforced in all areas of the two adjoining valley districts. The protesters, responding to a call by six local clubs and Meira Paibis (women activists), demonstrated by holding placards and shouting slogans while attempting to enter Andro and Porompat police stations in Imphal East, and Singjamei, Kwakeithel and Mayang Imphal police outposts in Imphal West district.They demanded the release of the five arrested men, claiming that they were village defence volunteers.In response, police and RAF personnel used tear gas shells to disperse the crowds. The five men remain in police custody. According to police, one of them is a trained member of a banned militant outfit of the state, while another is a drug addict running a rehabilitation centre.Eralier, normal life in the Imphal valley was paralysed by a 48-hour bandh called by Meira Paibis and local clubs, demanding the release of the arrested men. The bandh ended Wednesday. The organisations asked people to assemble at their nearest police station on Thursday. Security forces conducted search operations in various districts, recovering arms and ammunition, including mortar shells. A joint team of Assam Rifles and state police seized four mortar bombs hidden in bushes during a search in Kangpokpi district.\"Search operations were conducted by security forces in the fringe and vulnerable areas of Imphal West, Thoubal, Bishnupur, Kangpokpi and Churachandpur districts in which one arm, two local pumpi guns, 50 ammunition and eight explosives were recovered from Imphal West and Kangpokpi districts,\" the police tweeted.Police have installed 127 checkpoints in the valley and hill districts and detained 873 people on Wednesday for violating rules. Strict security measures have been implemented in vulnerable locations, and security convoys are providing safe passage for vehicles in sensitive areas. HC cuts fine on two convicted rebels, paves way for releaseDelhi high court on Thursday reduced the fine imposed on two convicted members of Manipur-based terrorist organisation Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP), who had pleaded guilty in a terror case, saying their admission of guilt is a clear indication of possibility of reform. Paving the way for their release after seven years behind bars, HC reduced the fine from Rs 39,000 to Rs 9,000 each, imposed on convicts Khoiram Ranjit Singh and Pukhrihongam Prem Kumar Meiti after taking note that their families are not in a financial position to pay the entire amount as a result of which the duo will have no alternative but undergo default sentence of additional 30 months. A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anish Dayal said there is no reason why they are being penalised for their poor financial condition since that has no relation to the sentence undergone for the offences they were convicted of.',\n",

In a court filing, OpenAI said the claims \"misconceive the scope of copyright, failing to take into account the limitations and exceptions (including fair use) that properly leave room for innovations like the large language models now at the forefront of artificial intelligence.\"Author objections to AI have helped lead Amazon.com, the country\\'s largest book retailer, to change its policies on e-books. The online giant is now asking writers who want to publish through its Kindle Direct Program to notify Amazon in advance that they are including AI-generated material.

The chargesheet named Verma, one Dr Luv Gupta and absconding Dr Akhilesh Pal. The case came to light in July 2022 and Verma was arrested in July this year.The chargesheet said Dr Verma called the Shahapur-based victim and her father, Manohar Patole, to his cabin in Sion Hospital premises and assured them of admission under the dean\\'s quota. They paid Verma Rs 20 lakh at that time and another Rs 45 lakh when Verma\\'s accomplice, Luv Gupta, made the victim fill the admission form and emailed him an allotment letter on the dean\\'s letterhead regarding the admission. Police have also filed a chargesheet against Sahiba Shaikh whose bank account was used by Verma to transfer a few lakhs. Sahiba has procured anticipatory bail from Bombay high court on the grounds that she has no role in the alleged scam. The chargesheet is the first against Verma in the court. Police have attached the statements of various banks in which the money was transferred.There are 13 offences of cheating registered against Verma and his accomplices.Last year, the home department had formed a special investigation ieam (SIT) of the crime branch to probe the MBBS admission racket.The chargesheet is based on the complaint filed by Patole who alleged he was looking for MBBS admission for his daughter. While searching for a seat under the management quota in November 2020, Patole came across Verma whom he met in Sion Hospital. Gupta and Pal were also present.Gupta demanded Rs 1 crore for a seat at Somaiya Medical College in Sion and Rs 80 lakh for one at Sion medical college. The accused even sent an e-mail using the dean\\'s ID to the complainant confirming the admission, the officer said.\"From January 2021 to April 2021, the girl attended online classes for MBBS first year. Gupta then started demanding the remaining Rs 45 lakh, but Patole asked him to wait till regular classes began,\\'\\' said the chargesheet. Later, the complainant learnt an offence was registered against Verma who was suspended; the authorities received a few complaints of irregularities in the hospital. One Alisha Shaikh from Madhya Pradesh who completed her MBBS was looking for post-graduation when she met a tout who on behalf of Verma demanded Rs 1.5 crore, of which her father paid Rs 29 lakh.

       " \"NEW DELHI: Describing Canada as a haven for terrorists, a characterisation it had used so far only for Pakistan, the government Thursday suspended visa processing services in the North American country saying Indian diplomats were unable to perform their duties because of the threats they faced from Khalistan forces. Reiterating that Canadian diplomats were involved in anti-India activities, India also asked Canada to reduce its diplomatic strength here. The government said there had to be parity between diplomatic presence in both countries as Canada had a much stronger presence here than the other way around.India Canada News Live UpdatesAmid the raging diplomatic dispute over allegations by Canadian PM Justin Trudeau that India might be involved in the killing of Khalistan leader and Canadian national Hardeep Singh Nijjar, the government also suspended e-visa facility for Canadian citizens and said they won't be allowed to apply for Indian visa even from third countries. With Canada yet to provide any evidence or even information linking India to the killing, the Centre called Trudeau’s allegations ``politically motivated’’ and marked by prejudice as Canada had expelled an Indian diplomat only on the basis of allegations. 'Take action': India gives list of 20 Khalistan ultras to Canada While India has asked Canada to reduce its staff strength, and the details are still being worked out, whether the government formally downgrades diplomatic ties will likely depend on how Canada reacts to the move. MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India was ready to look into any specific piece of evidence or information from Canada, but so far nothing had been shared. India also called upon Canada to act on a list of more than 20 Khalistan terrorists it has shared with Canadian authorities several times in the past.``We have provided very specific information to Canada but it has not been acted upon. We have shared the same list many times in the past too,’’ said Bagchi, adding that it’s Canada that needs to worry about any reputational harm as terrorism is being funded and supported and safe haven provided there. ``Canada’s reputation as a safe haven for terrorism and extremism is growing,’’ said the Indian official, adding that Canada’s inaction against such forces had forced India to stall visa operations. He said the main issue between the 2 countries was terrorism and called upon Canada to act against pro-Khalistan forces. While the US and Australia have said that they engaged India on Trudeau’s allegations, the Indian government is also in touch with close partners over the issue.The last time India was involved in a diplomatic row of such intensity with a Western country was in 2013-14 with the US in the Devyani Khobragade case but India had then not asked the Americans to reduce the strength of their diplomatic missions here. In fact, in recent memory, India has only asked Pakistan to do so, in 2020, because of the involvement of Pakistani diplomats in, as India had then said, terrorist activities. On this occasion too, the government said Canada had been asked to cut staff strength because of their participation in anti-India activities. The Canadian high commission also said it's looking to ``adjust'' staff presence in India but added it was because of the threats faced by Canadian diplomats in India. Canada, however, said its high commission and consulates remained functional and were serving clients. ``In light of the current environment where tensions have heightened, we are taking action to ensure the safety of our diplomats. With some diplomats having received threats on various social media platforms, Global Affairs Canada is assessing its staff complement in India. As a result, and out of an abundance of caution, we have decided to temporarily adjust staff presence in India,’’ said the Canadian high commission, adding that it expected India to provide for the security of diplomats and consular officers in India in line with the Vienna conventions.\",\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: Making delimitation the basis for reserving one-third seats in the Lok Sabha and state assemblies for women will not only instil public trust in the process - given that the Delimitation Commission is headed by a retired Supreme Court judge with the chief election commissioner as an ex-officio member and MPs/MLAs across party lines as associate members - but also insulate the final delimitation order from any future judicial challenge, according to government sources.Article 329 of the Constitution of India states that the validity of any law relating to delimitation of constituencies or the allotment of seats to such constituencies, made or purporting to be under Article 327 or Article 328 (dealing with elections to the Lok Sabha or state assemblies respectively), \"shall not be called in question in any court\". This provision was mirrored in Section 10 of the Delimitation Act, 2002, which states that the delimitation award, upon publication in the Gazette of India, shall have the force of law and not be called in question in any court.Home minister Amit Shah had underlined that the Delimitation Commission being a quasi-judicial body, conducts its proceedings transparently, through public hearings. As per Section 7 of the Delimitation Act, 2002, the Delimitation Commission determines its own procedure and has all the powers of a civil court. During its public hearings on the draft delimitation proposal, the objections and suggestions of various stakeholders are heard in a transparent manner and, if found valid, incorporated by amending the draft. The last step is publication of the final delimitation award, which is insulated from any judicial challenge.Delimitation is based on Census figures and the deferred Census 2021 is likely to be taken up as the first step towards implementation of the women\\'s quota. Delimitation was linked to women\\'s quota in the Lok Sabha and state assemblies as it is a scientific and transparent method.Delimitation will follow once the Census throws up population data, including by gender, residence and SC ST.Soon after the delimitation award outlining constituencies to be reserved for women is published, the EC can start putting together the electoral rolls for the newly- constituencies.

       " \"There seems to be no stopping for Shah Rukh Khan’s Jawan, as the record breaking spree of the film continues. The movie is all set to break Gadar 2’s box office collection. Gadar 2 till Tuesday, had collected about Rs 520 crore and Jawan stood at Rs 517 crore across languages, as per Sacnilk. The film is expected to collect about Rs 8 crore on Friday which will take it well past Gadar 2’s collection.It had taken Gadar 2 more than three weeks to cross the Rs 500 crore mark but Jawan was able to reach that feat in just about 2 weeks. And it is expected that with the way Jawan is going at the box office, in a few weeks, it can beat Pathaan’s collection to become the highest grossing film for Shah Rukh Khan. He has already become the only actor to deliver two 500 crore hits at the box office in the same year.Though comparing Gadar 2 and Jawan, one needs to understand that Gadar 2 was made at the budget of just Rs 75 crore, whereas the budget for Jawan was about Rs 300 crore as confirmed by Atlee in an interview.Post the success of the movie, Shah Rukh Khan held a press conference and talking about the humongous numbers the film has been collecting he said, “It's a celebration. We rarely get a chance to live with a film for years. The making of Jawan has been going on for four years due to Covid and time constraints. There were a lot of people involved in this film, especially people from the South who came and settled in Mumbai and have been living in Mumbai for the last four years and working day and night for this film, which is the hardest work ever.”The film also starred Nayanthara, Vijay Sethupati, Deepika Padukone and Sanjay Dutt in special appearances.Sanya Malhotra, Priyamani, Girija Oak, Sanjeeta Bhattacharya, Lehar Khan, Aaliyah Qureshi, Ridhi Dogra, Sunil Grover and Mukesh Chhabra formed the strong supporting cast of the film.\",\n",

       " \"It was bad enough that Justin Trudeau had to swelter in New Delhi till September 12 because his plane failed him. Coming after an unusually public dressing down by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his outburst on September 19 accusing India of killing Khalistan leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar sealed his now-dead relationship with India.Canada is where wokeness and brightly patterned socks find their illogical home. Which would have been idyllic if their political parties were not so welcoming of bad guys of many stripes. Trudeau not only did himself a disservice but he has also, perversely, made Modi a hero in India, just before the general election — without a Balakot, to boot.The narrative of India tracking down its enemies in the far corners of Earth is so compelling. Internet memes are comparing Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to Mossad. Though we are a bit mystified. How did RAW get Nijjar halfway across the world, while our friendly neighbour Hafiz Mohammed Saeed bids fair to marking a century on Earth?Watch: Former RAW chief slams Trudeau's claims As Trudeau dialled up all those Five Eyes (FVEY) partners, he shone the light on how Canada is actually the Pakistan of the Western world. FVEY, whom he called on September 19 to say Indian ‘agents’ had assassinated a terror leader in Canada, will now be compelled to look more closely not only at how Canadians fund their politics and where that trail actually leads, but also to look in their own backyards.What happened in Surrey, British Columbia, will not stay in Surrey, British Columbia. Trudeau has created a problem not merely for Canada and India but also for his key allies, particularly the US and Britain.Jumping the gunCuriously, Trudeau said Canadian security agencies were pursuing “credible allegations”, not credible ‘intelligence’ or ‘evidence’, of a killing that happened three months ago.The ‘allegations’ came from two sources that the Canadian media has reported — Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, head of the banned-in-India Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), and Trudeau’s political partner Jagmeet Singh ‘Jimmy’ Dhaliwal.You would think a prime minister would address a serious national security affair armed with more than ‘allegations’. Unfortunately, after his statement, any Canadian investigation is likely to be ‘coloured’ to align with the official line, because, in the real world, politics determines everything.At around the same time that Trudeau was displaying righteous anger, a Congress party leader in Moga, Baljinder Singh Balli, was killed by gangster Arsh Dalla, Nijjar’s associate and currently enjoying Canadian hospitality. No allegations necessary here. Dalla announced it on Facebook.Why did Trudeau do it? Out of pique? Or is there something else? It’s an old story that Trudeau’s Liberal Party owes a lot of its political cache to Canada’s Sikh community. He can no longer distinguish between regular hardworking Sikhs and the extremists. The Sikhs are now the most politically influential community in Canada — the ‘Brampton Munda’ is more than a hip-hop number. The Khalistan project had quietened. But, in recent years, it has seen a fresh lease of life, in Canada, Britain, the US and Australia.Canada is starting a public inquiry into ‘election interference’, particularly by China, where Trudeau’s Liberals will likely find nowhere to hide, given their well-established close ties with Beijing. Jagmeet included Iran, India and Russia in that inquiry.As recently as May, China was running extraterritorial ‘secret’ police stations in Canada, under the benevolent gaze of the Trudeau government to target dissident Chinese. Any public inquiry will throw up these uncomfortable facts. Much better to throw India under the bus.Canadian pension funds and private equity companies are deeply invested in India. Indian students are the top source for Canada. The present political chasm is not good for business. But politics has a way of overlooking the obvious.Divided communityCanadian Sikhs are divided — the big battle is the control of gurdwaras and real estate masquerading as gurdwaras. This leads to a well-oiled immigration and funding racket that frankly flies in the face of the rule of law that Trudeau extolled.Second, India’s outreach to Sikhs overseas and removal of many from the blacklist pitted Khalistanis against Khalistanis and put up Trudeau’s back.For instance, Ripudaman Singh Malik, accused in the Kanishka bombing and killed in July 2022 in exactly the same way as Nijjar, wrote a letter to Modi complaining against other ‘anti-India’ Sikhs (read: Nijjar). And there are the inevitable links between organised crime and the drug trade.Watch: Is Trudeau's time coming to an end? A big source of funding and support for Khalistanis is Pakistan. These are funnelled through Pakistani missions in Canada and Britain. The next time you see a Khalistan protest on TV, look out for a map of Khalistan — it includes Delhi but not an inch of Pakistani Punjab.The Canadian government has gone where many have feared to tread. In 2018, a report by the Canadian ministry of public safety on the terror threat to Canada referenced “Sikh [Khalistani] extremist ideologies and movements” as being among the top five threats to Canada. Under pressure, the Trudeau government removed these references in an edited version in 2019, enabling Trudeau to make up with the community just before Baisakhi celebrations.The Modi-led government’s biggest strategic error was to open the Kartarpur corridor in 2019. It helped Pakistan revive a dormant Khalistan asset, a low-cost proxy. It did not help Modi win Sikh votes. Brampton, we have a problem.The writer is CEO, Ananta Aspen Centre.\",\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON: Under pressure on world stage to produce evidence to back up its allegation that New Delhi is behind the assassination of an immigrant Sikh militant, the Canadian government has claimed in leaks to the media that it has \"both human and signals intelligence\" pointing to the involvement of Indian officials in the killing. The intelligence, which is said to also implicate Indian diplomats serving in Canada, did not come solely from Canada; some was provided by an unnamed ally in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported on Thursday night, citing unnamed government sources. Canada, US, UK, Australia, and New Zealand are members of the alliance. Signals intelligence would typically mean electronic eavesdropping; the unnamed Five Eyes ally, going by the vehemence with which Washington came out today in support of Canada, points to the United States. At a White House briefing, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Washington is consulting closely with Canada on the issue supports the efforts that they are undertaking in this investigation. The US has also been in touch with the Indian government, he added. Sullivan denied there was any \"wedge\" between the US and Canada on the issue and asserted that \"as soon as we heard from the Canadian prime minister publicly about the allegations, we went out publicly ourselves and expressed our deep concern about them, our support for a law enforcement process to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.\"\"We have deep concerns about the allegations, and we would like to see this investigation carried forward and the perpetrators held to account. That is what the United States has stood for from the moment this emerged in public, and we will continue to stand for that until this fully plays its way out,\" he added. Asked if President Biden intends to speak to PM Modi about the Canadian allegations and if the incident could drive a wedge between the US and India, Sullivan declined to get into \"private diplomatic conversations that have either already happened or are going to happen on this topic, only to say that we have been and will be in contact with the Indians at high levels on this issue.\" Sullivan\\'s national security counterpart in India is Ajit Doval.Although the US itself has carried out trans-national assassinations, including of its own citizens (notably Anwar al Awlaki, an Islamic scholar who was killed in Yemen in a Drone strike), Sullivan maintained that no country could get a free pass for such an action. \"It is a matter of concern for us. It is something we take seriously. It’s something we will keep working on, and we will do that regardless of the country. There is not some special exemption you get for actions like this. Regardless of the country, we will stand up and defend our basic principles. And we will also consult closely with allies like Canada as they pursue their law enforcement and diplomatic process,\" he said. The CBC report meanwhile cited \"Canadian sources\" saying that \"when pressed behind closed doors, no Indian official has denied the bombshell allegation at the core of this case — that there is evidence to suggest Indian government involvement in the assassination of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.\" New Delhi has said Canada has produced no evidence to back its allegations. Trudeau too has used the word allegations, not evidence, in accusing India of involvement. \"I can assure you that the decision to share these allegations on the floor of the House of Commons … was not done lightly,\" Trudeau said Thursday in New York after attending the United Nations General Assembly. \"It was done with the utmost seriousness.\"',\n",
       " \"Spots up for grabs in World Cup dress rehearsal vs AustraliaOn the face of it, the three-match ODI series between India and Australia, as Pakistan legend Wasim Akram pointed out recently, is pretty much a needless exercise. Squeezed just before the 2023 World Cup, it leaves both the teams with a potential danger of injuring their top players, or at least leaving them jaded. The first ODI at Mohali on Friday will mark the start of Team India's 'Bharat Darshan,' which will involve travelling to as many as 14 cities till November 12 - no mean task even for seasoned backpackers. However, a deeper look at things will tell you that this series does have some value for both the teams. For India, who are just fresh off the Asia Cup triumph, these games offer the best chance to find, hopefully, a final answer to the ' R Ashwin question' in white-ball cricket, which keeps popping up every few years.With left-arm spinner Axar Patel out due to a left quadriceps strain, India have gone back to their old warhorse, off-spinner, who has just turned 37. Having been put on alert since Axar's injury, Ashwin has done all the right things-trained at the NCA, bowled 10 overs in a local league game in Chennai, but nothing can replace the value of this outing - resuming his battle with the likes of Steve Smith and David Warner on featherbeds. Ashwin last played ODIs for India 18 months ago against South Africa in South Africa. Making a comeback in this format after four-and-half years, he wasn't too successful in that series, taking 1-53 in 10 overs 0-68 in 10 overs in the final two games.Previously, he was dropped in 2017 after enduring an ordinary time in the Champions Trophy in England. Still, a few factors make Ashwin's unexpected recall at this hour understandable. His rich experience - 151 wickets in 113 ODIs@33.49, the presence of dangerous left-handers in almost every opposition and the likelihood of wickets which aid spin during India's World Cup matches in the 2023 ODI World Cup - all indicate there may be a place for Ashwin after all.India have also rested their lead spinner Kuldeep Yadav, putting the focus on Ashwin. For starters, the offie would have to stave off competition from Washington Sundar. The other issue is the fitness status of Shreyas Iyer. Picked for the Asia Cup, all the middle order batsman played was two games - in the one against Pakistan, the 28-year-old scored 14, and against Nepal he didn't get to bat. Thereafter, he sat out due to back spasms for four games on a trot, certainly not a good sign for someone returning after a long layoff.With skipper Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli and even allrounder Hardik Pandya resting for the first two games, the likes of Iyer and Suryakumar Yadav, who have endured an ordinary time in the ODIs, will need to assert themselves in this series.Australia will be bolstered by the return of skipper Pat Cummins and Steve Smith from injuries.\",\n",

       " \"HANGZHOU: India's three leading female wushu players - all hailing from Arunachal Pradesh- who are part of the country's Asian Games contingent were forced to stay back in Delhi even as other team members reached Hangzhou Thursday morning. The trio didn't receive necessary clearances from Chinese authorities to enter the mainland, TOI has learnt.The players, Nyeman Wangsu, Onilu Tega and Mepung Lamgu, were scheduled to fly out as part of an 11-member wushu contingent - seven male and four female athletes - on a Cathay Pacific flight Wednesday night from IGI airport in New Delhi. They were to take part in individual events of the martial arts sport. The trio are now accommodated at Sports Authority of India's JLN hostel till the issue of their participation is resolved. Visa issue: Wushu players meet RijijuThe wushu competitions will run from September 24 to 28 at the Guali Cultural Sports Centre in Xiaoshan district. In July, a 12-member wushu team’s trip to Chengdu for the World University Games was called off after the Chinese embassy in Delhi issued ‘stapled visas’ to the same trio of Arunachal athletes, prompting an angry reaction from India’s external affairs ministry which termed the move “unacceptable”. In the latest incident, the three athletes, according to sources in the Wushu Association of India (WAI), were not being cleared to proceed beyond Hong Kong to China after their accreditation cards could not be downloaded for validation. They were booked on a Delhi-Hong Kong-Hangzhou route. “Their clearances have not arrived to enter China. We, at the federation, were unable to download their accreditation cards for the Games while the remaining members of the team could download theirs without any issues. The accreditation card acts as your visa. So, we decided to leave without them, hoping they could join the team before the competitions begin,” one of the sources said. “Our chef-de-mission, Bhupendra Singh Bajwa, has already taken up the matter with the Asian Games organising committee while the Indian government has also been apprised of the matter. Bajwa has reached the Athletes’ Village in Hangzhou and will be discussing the matter with the organisers — the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA). In fact, Bajwa and Indian Olympic Association’s joint secretary and acting CEO Kalyan Chaubey had met the Chinese ambassador in Delhi some time ago to discuss the difficulty faced by some athletes in securing accreditation,” the source added. It’s been learnt that the three players met former union sports minister Kiren Rijiju on Thursday afternoon and requested his intervention to secure their passage for participation at the Games. Rijiju is a three-time MP in Lok Sabha from Arunachal Pradesh and currently holds the portfolio of minister of earth sciences.

       " 'NEW DELHI: The long and seemingly interminable wait for parliamentary clearance for women\\'s quota in legislatures ended on Thursday, and on an emphatic note, as Rajya Sabha unanimously endorsed the Constitution (128th Amendment) Bill 2023 that seeks to reserve one-third of seats in Lok Sabha and state legislatures.The unanimous 214-0 vote, a rare if not the only one so far, after a debate stretching over 11 hours clears the way for the government to secure the President\\'s assent - a prerequisite but yet a formality. Once enacted, the women\\'s quota bill (Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam) will automatically apply to assemblies of all states and UTs of Delhi and Puducherry. Government sources told TOI that the amendment does not need to be ratified by half the states because it is Parliament which has the prerogative to decide the strength of assemblies which have no say in the matter. An idea that was too strong to be opposedAs in Lok Sabha on Wednesday, the resounding across-the-aisle \"aye\" for the bill in Rajya Sabha on Thursday, which can potentially not only change the dynamics of politics but also influence gender equations in society, underscored the strength the idea of women\\'s quota has gathered. Opposition parties, though convinced that the legislation has BJP\\'s political calculations as the sub-text, preferred to go along rather than be the wrench that had wrecked similar efforts in the past, beginning 1996. Even OBC parties, which had stalled, with the covert indulgence of those who feared that their seats would be assigned to the \\'reserved-for-women\\' category, played along after proforma reiteration of their demand for a sub-quota for OBCs and Muslims within the larger women\\'s quota. The dissenters moved amendments but could not bring themselves to vote for them. All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, which spoiled a similar show of solidarity in Lok Sabha with both its members voting against the bill, has no representation in the RS.Both Houses were adjourned sine die a day before the scheduled close of the special session. PM Narendra Modi, who called it right, from convening the special session to keeping the \"agenda\" under wraps, instantly expressed delight. \"A defining moment in our nation\\'s democratic journey. Congratulations to 140 crore Indians. I thank all the RS MPs who voted for the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam. Such unanimous support is indeed gladdening,\" he said.Modi had reached Rajya Sabha, a rare appearance on the day of a vote by a PM who is a member of Lok Sabha, to make an appeal to MPs for a unanimous vote. \"Such a positive approach will boost the confidence of our women,\" he said. Modi loomed large over the proceedings, with ministers and BJP speakers giving him the credit for pushing the bill and giving its passage, enactment and enforcement his personal \"guarantee\". There was loud applause when RS chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar announced that as per the Hindu calendar, the day also happened to be the PM\\'s birthday.The quota will come into force after delimitation of seats, which can be taken up only after 2026 as there is a freeze on altering seats until then as per the 84th constitutional amendment which mandates that the next delimitation exercise be done based on the first population census conducted after 2026. Government sources, however, said the census, which was due in 2021 but could not be done due to Covid, would be taken up immediately after the Lok Sabha polls and the same census would be made the basis for the delimitation commission to demarcate constituencies.Government sources said there was contemplation about taking the required legislative process, which would also silence the opposition parties questioning the lag between passage of the bill and its execution. A senior government functionary confirmed that after the freeze on increase of seats is over in 2026, Lok Sabha and assembly seats would be increased as per the recommendations of the delimitation commission.However, the government functionary confirmed that the number of seats would be increased in proportion to the existing numbers in states and not based on the headcount, an apprehension south Indian states, having been more effective in birth control, had raised. The bill managed to sail through without any resistance although opposition parties demanded alterations like inclusion of OBC and Muslim quota. They paused their objections when it came to supporting it, also seen as a course correction as the bill failed to win the trust of Parliament five times in the past, once despite being passed by Rajya Sabha in 2010, which happened months after being introduced in the House. The bill, after being referred to Lok Sabha, had lapsed with dissolution of the lower House in 2014.A government functionary also said the demand for OBC inclusion in women\\'s quota was far-fetched as it was not even in the 2010 bill passed in Rajya Sabha when UPA was in office and there was a cabinet note against it.',\n",

He has already become the only actor to deliver two 500 crore hits at the box office in the same year.Though comparing Gadar 2 and Jawan, one needs to understand that Gadar 2 was made at the budget of just Rs 75 crore, whereas the budget for Jawan was about Rs 300 crore as confirmed by Atlee in an interview.Post the success of the movie, Shah Rukh Khan held a press conference and talking about the humongous numbers the film has been collecting he said, “It's a celebration. We rarely get a chance to live with a film for years. The making of Jawan has been going on for four years due to Covid and time constraints.

       " 'BENGALURU: India’s move to suspend visa services to Canadian citizens amid a diplomatic row is likely to have triggered concerns among technology companies, professionals and entrepreneurs.While potential new contracts could get delayed, the impact on projects that Indian IT companies are already implementing there may be limited, since Canada has not halted visa applications by Indians to Canada.If Canada were to also stop visa applications, the implications could be more significant. On the whole though, considering the world learnt to work without travel during the Covid pandemic, visa restrictions are unlikely to severely handicap business in the short term.Vikram Shroff, head of HR Law at Nishith Desai Associates, said the Indian government’s decision implies that investors, entrepreneurs, and techies who are Canadian citizens may not be able to get visas to travel to India. \"Technology talent mobility would be adversely affected between the two countries,” he said. Shroff said the decision does not affect those Canadian citizens who have an existing Indian visa or OCI card. “It also does not affect Indian citizens to continue to travel to Canada including for family, business, or education purposes,” he noted.More than 600 Canadian companies have a presence in India and over 1,000 Canadian companies are pursuing business interests in India. Indian IT companies have a sizable exposure to outsourcing work from Canadian companies. Earlier, this year, Montreal-based Bombardier roped in TCS to modernise the former’s legacy systems that support its engineering, manufacturing, aftermarket services and defence activities. Last year, TCS became the new title sponsor of the TCS Toronto Waterfront Marathon that includes developing a race app in partnership with Canada Running Series (CRS) to provide an integrated digital experience. Infosys has committed to hire 8,000 Canadians by 2024 and it’s well past the halfway mark. Wipro has a big contractual relationship with Canadian energy utilities company Atco to provide outsourcing solutions.Indian IT firms have centres in Mississauga, Ontario, Montreal, Quebec, and Waterloo, all of which are premier tech talent hotspots. Canadian fund houses have invested in India\\'s startup ecosystem. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), for instance, has invested at least Rs 1.7 lakh crore in India. It has investments in companies including Nykaa, Acko, Byju\\'s and Zomato. Canadian fund Ontario Teachers has invested more than $3 billion in India.Cyrus D Mehta, managing partner of New York-based law firm Cyrus D Mehta Partners, said, “Although India has suspended visas for Canadians, it would not be wise for Canada to block visas for Indian nationals. While countries can engage in tit for tat retaliation with diplomats, it should not extend such tit for tat to visa policy. Keeping the immigration channels open helps to diffuse tensions and improve understanding among the people of both countries.”India’s apex tech body Nasscom said it is in close touch with its members in Canada and as per their feedback there are no immediate areas of concern. \"Since this is an evolving situation, we will continue to engage with stakeholders to track any potential areas of impact that may need support,” it said.',\n",

In absolute numbers, an increase of 75,000 applications, year-on-year, is a record,\" Singh told TOI.Female registrations see a 3% increase in CAT this yearThe high numbers, said experts, reflect sustained interest students have in the field of management and in IIMs. \"I believe increased publicity about CAT on social media platforms and adding more test cities with increase in exam centres, particularly in tier-II cities, have resulted in this highest-ever registrations,\" said Prof Singh. Of the total 3.3 lakh, 1.17 lakh, or 38%, are female. There has been a 3% increase in female registrations. Over the past decade, IIMs have taken multiple steps to increase gender diversity in management education. Consequently, IIMs have anywhere between 30% and 45% female students on their campuses. Till 2008, CAT was a pen and-paper test. This year, 2.9 lakh applicants had registered, which was the previous highest number of registernations. \"The first computer-based test was held in 2009,\" said Prof Singh. After this, the numbers dipped and rose gradually. While 2.41 lakh registered themselves in 2019, the number dipped in 2020 to 2.28, when the first wave of Covid-19 hit the world- .CAT 2023 will be a computer-based test of 120 minutes. The test will have the following three sections: Section I: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Section II: Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning, Section III: Quantitative Ability. Candidates will be allotted 40 minutes for answering questions in each section and they will not be allowed to switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section.

She hasn’t given one in years, and now a video is going viral where she is stating the reason why she stays away from the media.In the video, Nayanthara was speaking to Asianet and gave her reasons for staying away from the media. She mentioned that the media was targeting her unnecessarily with gossip and rumours which hurt her and her family. Back then, she was also affected by wedding rumours.Nayanthara was also criticized by Malayalam audiences for appearing in glamorous roles in Tamil movies as opposed to simple but powerful roles in Malayalam. She also explained the dynamics of Tamil Cinema and understands that in films led by Rajinikanth and Ajith, she can’t play a prominent role.“Won’t my family get hurt? What did I do for my family to get hurt? What I am doing is my work. I am doing what my directors are telling me. No one can point out anything in that. Why are you doing glamorous [roles] and not doing homely [roles]. No one has the right to ask all these things. If you like it, you can watch, if you don’t like it then don’t watch. There are so many people who like to watch and who like me. You can criticize but you need to be right about things,” Nayanthara said in the interview.“You shouldn’t have done this character this way, or your acting was not to the point, these are proper criticisms. And not the ones who come and say why did you do that, etc. This is why I stopped giving interviews, and when there are controversies about me, I know when I need to clarify, and I will clarify only at that time. Otherwise, I would not say anything. A lot of things are written about me to provoke me, I just simply don’t get provoked. Only when I feel I want to speak about something, only that time I will talk about it,” she added.',\n",

       " 'CHENNAI: Medical admissions are likely to get tougher as new regulations by the undergraduate medical board of the National Medical Commission will bar Tamil Nadu from adding new medical colleges government or private or adding more than 150 MBBS seats in existing colleges.The \\'guidelines for undergraduate courses under the establishment of new medical institutions, starting of new medical courses, and increase of seats for existing course and assessment and rating regulation 2023\\' published in the Gazette of India on August 16 has two major decisions of the Centre.First, it caps the total number of MBBS seats in a medical college at 150. The letter of permission for starting new medical colleges after 2023-24 shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/ I00/ 150 MBBS seats, the notification said. Colleges seeking an increase in the number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS students from the year 2024-25. The commission has, however, exempted applicants, who have already sent applications seeking an increase in MBBS seats.Second, it says medical colleges shall follow the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for l0 lakh population in that state or UT. This means Tamil Nadu, which has more than 10,000 seats in more than 70 medical colleges, cannot apply for more colleges. The state has a population of about a little over 8 crore.The notification does not offer justification for the decision, but senior doctors in the NMC said the decision was made to ensure resources are spent judiciously to ensure uniform distribution of doctors across the country. \"TN has more than 1.8 lakh doctors registered in Tamil Nadu and among them, 1.5 lakh are still practicing. The recommended ratio of doctors is only 1:1000 and we already have 1 per 600,\" said PG medical board member Dr K Senthil, also president of the TN Government Doctors\\' Association. With a fertility rate of 1.4, there is a decline in population. \"In ten years, TN will have 1 doctor for every 350 people because every year 10,000 MBBS graduates and 1,500 foreign medical graduates apply for a medical license,\" he said. The southern states must use this as an opportunity to increase post-graduate and super specialty seats, he said.However, Tamil Nadu health secretary Gagadeep Singh Bedi said the state has a policy of establishing a medical college in every district to ensure equal distribution of doctors and tertiary care facilities equally. \"Also, why should we look at Tamil Nadu data alone? The country needs more doctors. If Chennai can work well as a medical hub for the rest of India, doctors from here can work in other states too. When we have the facilities and requirements we must be permitted to start new facilities,\" he said.',\n",

The methodology used to recharge is that earth around the wells were excavated to a width of 1.20 to 1.50 metres and to a depth of 0.75metres. Perforated horizontal and vertical pipes are laid around the wells in four directions to collect the surface water. These pipes are closed by end caps and are covered by wire mesh to prevent the entry of dirt and other dust particles.In an attempt to invite the attention of people and to create awareness on water conservation, water harvesting and recharging structures, the outer structure of the wells were beautified. The outer structure of the wells were redesigned to give an aesthetic appearance in various shapes such as a train compartments, cup and saucer, basket, gift box, watermelon, treasure box etc.An assistant engineer, DRDA, G Prakash Kumar said that the main objective of the project is to recharge and rejuvenate the abandoned wells to recharge the groundwater at the locality. The wells which were abandoned due to lack of water and were used for dumping garbage due to lack of water had now become recharge structures. The top portion of the wells were also closed using steel railings to prevent any mishaps. Steps are also taken to ensure that the rejuvenated wells are maintained properly. \"The wells for this project were strategically chosen based on their location. The wells situated near overhead water tanks and near water tanks were chosen so that the water overflowing from the tanks would drain into the wells for recharge. The wells situated in the low lying areas were also chosen for the rain water to automatically drain to the well through the pipelines,\" he explained.He said that the significant aspect of this project is the beautification works. The outer portion of the wells were designed in various shapes such as train compartments, baskets, drums, coffee cups. The beautification works would help to create awareness among the public about the need for conservation of open wells, he added.The president of the Muthuramalingapuram village panchayat in Aruppukottai taluk, S Boominathan said that a well was in existence for the past 40 years. Due to lack of water the well was abandoned for the past over 25 years. However, the well presently acts as a groundwater recharge structure because it was taken up for rejuvenation and beautification under this project. He said that the well is situated close to an overhead water tank at Narthampatti village which comes under the Muthuramalingapuram village panchayat. Pipelines have been laid to drain the water overflowing from the tank inside the well. \"During the rainy season, rain water also drains inside the well. This project has not only turned an abandoned well into a recharge structure but it prevents any rain water stagnation at the area around the well,\" he noted.\"The well at our village has been redesigned in the shape of a basket and painted with attractive colours. It has become a place of attraction now. People who once did not know that such a well was in existence, look at the well with surprise now. It has also become a public space for children to play around since the well has now become safe with its top portion covered\", said Boominathan.\"I have never seen water in the well which is situated in our village for over 30 years. After this project was undertaken last year, I am happy to see water percolation inside the well for the very first time,\" said G Manoharan, president of the Pannaimoondradaippu village panchayat at Tiruchuli taluk.He said that the well in the village was just a small one which is only 30 feet in depth. It was defunct due to lack of water. \"After the well was rejuvenated under the project, the village received good rainfall during the monsoon season, last year. Since arrangements were made for rain water to drain into the well, water percolation is seen inside the well. With periodical maintenance, the well would be helpful in the years to come for groundwater recharge,\" he said.Manoharan said that the well situated in the village has been redesigned in the shape of train compartments on all four sides. \"This well has now become an identity of our village. People, especially children, became joyful when they saw the well in the shape of a train compartment. After the well was redesigned, whenever people saw me they used to ask me with a smile, \\'Thalaivare, rail engae pogudhu\\' (President, where is the train going)\", he added.',\n",

       " \"It was bad enough that Justin Trudeau had to swelter in New Delhi till September 12 because his plane failed him. Coming after an unusually public dressing down by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his outburst on September 19 accusing India of killing Khalistan leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar sealed his now-dead relationship with India.Canada is where wokeness and brightly patterned socks find their illogical home. Which would have been idyllic if their political parties were not so welcoming of bad guys of many stripes. Trudeau not only did himself a disservice but he has also, perversely, made Modi a hero in India, just before the general election — without a Balakot, to boot.The narrative of India tracking down its enemies in the far corners of Earth is so compelling. Internet memes are comparing Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to Mossad. Though we are a bit mystified. How did RAW get Nijjar halfway across the world, while our friendly neighbour Hafiz Mohammed Saeed bids fair to marking a century on Earth?Watch: Former RAW chief slams Trudeau's claims As Trudeau dialled up all those Five Eyes (FVEY) partners, he shone the light on how Canada is actually the Pakistan of the Western world. FVEY, whom he called on September 19 to say Indian ‘agents’ had assassinated a terror leader in Canada, will now be compelled to look more closely not only at how Canadians fund their politics and where that trail actually leads, but also to look in their own backyards.What happened in Surrey, British Columbia, will not stay in Surrey, British Columbia. Trudeau has created a problem not merely for Canada and India but also for his key allies, particularly the US and Britain.Jumping the gunCuriously, Trudeau said Canadian security agencies were pursuing “credible allegations”, not credible ‘intelligence’ or ‘evidence’, of a killing that happened three months ago.The ‘allegations’ came from two sources that the Canadian media has reported — Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, head of the banned-in-India Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), and Trudeau’s political partner Jagmeet Singh ‘Jimmy’ Dhaliwal.You would think a prime minister would address a serious national security affair armed with more than ‘allegations’. Unfortunately, after his statement, any Canadian investigation is likely to be ‘coloured’ to align with the official line, because, in the real world, politics determines everything.At around the same time that Trudeau was displaying righteous anger, a Congress party leader in Moga, Baljinder Singh Balli, was killed by gangster Arsh Dalla, Nijjar’s associate and currently enjoying Canadian hospitality. No allegations necessary here. Dalla announced it on Facebook.Why did Trudeau do it? Out of pique? Or is there something else? It’s an old story that Trudeau’s Liberal Party owes a lot of its political cache to Canada’s Sikh community. He can no longer distinguish between regular hardworking Sikhs and the extremists. The Sikhs are now the most politically influential community in Canada — the ‘Brampton Munda’ is more than a hip-hop number. The Khalistan project had quietened. But, in recent years, it has seen a fresh lease of life, in Canada, Britain, the US and Australia.Canada is starting a public inquiry into ‘election interference’, particularly by China, where Trudeau’s Liberals will likely find nowhere to hide, given their well-established close ties with Beijing. Jagmeet included Iran, India and Russia in that inquiry.As recently as May, China was running extraterritorial ‘secret’ police stations in Canada, under the benevolent gaze of the Trudeau government to target dissident Chinese. Any public inquiry will throw up these uncomfortable facts. Much better to throw India under the bus.Canadian pension funds and private equity companies are deeply invested in India. Indian students are the top source for Canada. The present political chasm is not good for business. But politics has a way of overlooking the obvious.Divided communityCanadian Sikhs are divided — the big battle is the control of gurdwaras and real estate masquerading as gurdwaras. This leads to a well-oiled immigration and funding racket that frankly flies in the face of the rule of law that Trudeau extolled.Second, India’s outreach to Sikhs overseas and removal of many from the blacklist pitted Khalistanis against Khalistanis and put up Trudeau’s back.For instance, Ripudaman Singh Malik, accused in the Kanishka bombing and killed in July 2022 in exactly the same way as Nijjar, wrote a letter to Modi complaining against other ‘anti-India’ Sikhs (read: Nijjar). And there are the inevitable links between organised crime and the drug trade.Watch: Is Trudeau's time coming to an end? A big source of funding and support for Khalistanis is Pakistan. These are funnelled through Pakistani missions in Canada and Britain. The next time you see a Khalistan protest on TV, look out for a map of Khalistan — it includes Delhi but not an inch of Pakistani Punjab.The Canadian government has gone where many have feared to tread. In 2018, a report by the Canadian ministry of public safety on the terror threat to Canada referenced “Sikh [Khalistani] extremist ideologies and movements” as being among the top five threats to Canada. Under pressure, the Trudeau government removed these references in an edited version in 2019, enabling Trudeau to make up with the community just before Baisakhi celebrations.The Modi-led government’s biggest strategic error was to open the Kartarpur corridor in 2019. It helped Pakistan revive a dormant Khalistan asset, a low-cost proxy. It did not help Modi win Sikh votes. Brampton, we have a problem.The writer is CEO, Ananta Aspen Centre.\",\n",

While the two Shah Rukh Khan starrers have been able to reach Rs 1000 crore mark, Sunny Deol\\'s film has crossed Rs 500 crore in the Indian market. Reflecting on the massive success of these Bollywood films, Salman Khan recently said that it is now time to look at new benchmarks like Rs 1000 crore as the coveted Rs 100 crore club has now become a thing of the past.At the trailer launch of Punjabi actor Gippy Grewal’s upcoming film Maujaan Hi Maujaan, it was mentioned how Punjabi films are doing exceptionally well at the box office. To which, Salman added that the way movies across industries are raking in moolah and setting new benchmarks, the new normal is going to be Rs 500-600 crore. \"I feel this Rs 100 crore mark is going to be the rock bottom now. Everything is going to be Rs 400-500-600 crore plus now for the Punjabi industry, Hindi industry, every industry. Even Marathi films are doing those numbers right now. Basically, people are going to the theatres once again to watch movies. I think Rs 100 crore is not going to be a very big deal. I think the benchmark should be Rs 1000 crore for a film right now,\" Salman said at the event.',\n",

He argued that reducing the NEET marks to zero percentile essentially allows all candidates who have taken the NEET-PG examination to secure a seat in private medical colleges, provided they have the financial means to do so. Dr. Ramadoss highlighted some alarming statistics, revealing that 30 candidates scored single-digit marks in the NEET-PG entrance exam, 14 candidates received zero marks, and 13 candidates even scored negative marks.According to him, all these students are now eligible for admission in private medical colleges. However, he emphasized that this approach would not enhance the quality of medical education in any way. Moreover, he pointed out that the majority of vacant PG seats are in private medical colleges. To address this issue and prevent a shortage of specialists, Dr Ramadoss called for private medical colleges to reduce their fees and for the government to conduct counselling for candidates who have already cleared the examination.MDMK leader Vaiko also criticized the NEET exam, describing it as an eyewash. He went a step further, characterizing NEET as a fraudulent examination and blaming it for the deaths of approximately 20 students in Tamil Nadu. Vaiko urged the Union government to discontinue the practice of conducting NEET.

Amit Mittal, whose son is a student in Surrey, said: “Already, we were tense since the diplomatic fallout, and now they have asked Hindus to leave Canada for not condemning Nijjar’s killing. The Canadian government shouldn’t allow religious hatred, for the sake of its own image.”Barnala’s Satish Bansal, whose daughter also studies in Surrey, said: “We have a big study loan to pay off and a dilemma to deal with.”How was Nijjar killed?Whether or not Indians in Canada condemn Nijjar’s killing, it’s important that law enforcement authorities are allowed to do their job without political or geopolitical pressure. So far, we understand that Canadian law enforcement agencies have apparently zeroed in on two suspicious vehicles -- a burnt car and a silver 2008 Toyota Camry – and suspect that at least one of them was the getaway vehicle used by the assassins who shot Nijjar.This, sources have confirmed, was reminiscent of several gang-related killings in the area in the recent past. The development, coupled with Canadian media quoting Nijjar\\'s son saying that his father was regularly meeting with Canadian intelligence officers in the months before he was shot dead in British Columbia, has deepened the mystery and raised questions on the claims made by the Canadian PM Justin Trudeau. The modus operandi involving \"a car on fire\" was also seen in a recent targeted killing of a man named Gagandeep Sandhu (29) who was shot dead in his car in Burnaby. About 15 minutes after this murder, police were alerted about a vehicle burning at some distance from the crime scene. The police, however, did not confirm whether the killing and the burnt black Honda Pilot SUV were connected and said an investigation was underway.Reports have said that the initial investigation into the killing was a likely fallout of bloody feud between the rival groups of Khalistanis.NIA releases list of 43 criminals, many with Canada Khalistan linksTightening the screw on gangsters operating out of Canada, the National Investigation Agency (NIA), India’s counter-terror agency, has issued a list of 43 most-wanted criminals, many of them associated with terror-gangster networks linked to Canada or the Khalistan movement.Urging the public to share details of properties and assets of the criminals, the NIA issued pictures of Lawrence Bishnoi, Jasdeep Singh, Kala Jatheri alias Sandeep, Virender Pratap alias Kala Rana and Joginder Singh along with their names.It highlighted that many of these gangsters are based in Canada. Canada based gangster Sukhdool Singh, also known as Sukha Duneke, shot dead in Winnipeg (Canada).

Hope traditional friends and partners can cooperate to get to the bottom of it,\" said Garcetti.The ambassador was responding to a question about how the US reconciled its call for India to facilitate the probe with India’s official position that the allegations made by Trudeau, who has sought India’s support to carry the investigations forward, were not just unsubstantiated but also absurd.Did Trudeau torpedo India’s reach out efforts? The Canadian government has torpedoed efforts by the Indian government to reach out to separatist Sikhs in Canada, bowing to pressure from extremist Khalistanis, a Canadian commentator has revealed. This comes amid growing scrutiny of Ottawa\\'s purported indulgence and patronage of militants.The Indian government\\'s outreach, according to columnist Terry Glavin in the National Post, came in 2016-17 when it sought the help of British Sikh activist Jasdev Singh Rai for talks with \"veteran Canadian Khalistanis who were growing weary of agitating for a separate Sikh state in India that India’s Sikhs want nothing to do with.\"Rai met the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service during several visits to Canada, but the Trudeau government bowed to a Khalistani-influenced group of gurudwara leaders and “obstructed the peace dialogue process,” Glavin quotes Rai as saying. Rai eventually found himself barred from Canada. Rai had not responded to requests for elaboration at the time of writing. The disclosure comes amid increasing scrutiny of what critics say is Trudeau\\'s double standard on issues of sovereignty and separatism, while accusing him of turning a blind eye to violent separatist Khalistanis operating openly in Canada.',\n",

When she was pronounced dead, they fled,\" a police officer said.Additional DCP (east) Syed Ali Abbas said that based on circumstantial evidence and presence of the murder weapon, Aditya was arrested.Police said that preliminary investigations have revealed that the victim had got in touch with the accused over Instagram barely ten days ago.\"The victim lived in a separate flat with her three friends in Gomtinagar while the accused was residing at Dayal Residency. On the fateful day, the student walked 3.5 km to reach the victim\\'s flat before the unfortunate incident took place,\" an officer said.',\n",
       " 'The situation in the country has become dire. For the past year, nearly every month has brought with it a feeling of foreboding. This, many Pakistanis routinely tell themselves, is certainly the lowest and worst point.To offset paying more than double the usual price for basic goods, they ration every drop of petrol by seeking alternative transportation options, buying less food, cheaper food, the cheapest food — but nothing seems to work. The continuing political instability, one government after another, the ever-looming threat of military intervention and the general uncertainty have not helped the situation.All of this has happened, but there seems to be more in the offing. The regular hikes in the price of petrol, the imposition of electricity tariffs and increase in the sales tax have all turned an already unbearable situation into one that is potentially catastrophic.Despite holding cabinet meetings on the issue of high electricity rates — a consequence of the deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) — the caretaker prime minister is unable to act against the exorbitant tariffs. Human Rights Watch has requested the IMF to review the impact of economic adjustments in countries where vulnerable groups will be affected. However, so far that help has not been forthcoming here. There are only so many corners to cut, only so much water added to milk, sawdust added to flour and pebbles eaten with lentils. After some time, there is only water and no milk, only sawdust and no flour and only pebbles and no lentils. The latest increase in prices, which is apparently necessary to sustain the deal with the IMF, points to such a situation. For political scientists researching political decisions, matters proceed according to what people assess to be in their self-interest.The poor sufferBut such calculations break down when the people have nothing to lose. In Pakistan, there will soon be millions of people whose lives have been so utterly wrecked by unchecked inflation and the unaffordability of even basic goods that their reactions to hunger, homelessness and hopelessness will be entirely unpredictable.Those whose lives are not immediately threatened by the unavailability of food and housing will possibly die in other ways. For instance, one of the major industries in Pakistan that is being affected by the economic crisis is the pharmaceutical industry. Banks are unwilling to open letters of credit due to the continuing lack of foreign exchange. For the current set-up, the pharmaceutical industry is an area of concern.The foreign exchange shortage means that the country may be hurtling towards a dearth of lifesaving drugs and the raw material needed to manufacture them. One example of this was when Panadol became unavailable last year. While it is not a lifesaving drug, the fact that there was a shortage of such a commonly used medicine, which then persisted, reveals the weaknesses in the market.Add to this the fact that there has been an ongoing pricing dispute, with drug manufacturers saying that because of the increased price of imported raw material required to make drugs, they wanted to hike prices by almost 40 per cent across the board. The problem is that without material to make the drugs there simply will not be sufficient medicine available to the people who need them. It does not appear that anything else is being done to avert this crisis or solve the impasse. It is terrifying to consider what would happen if drugs required by diabetics or basic broad-spectrum antibiotics are suddenly off the shelves.Pakistan’s poor are desperate and have been so for a long while now. This latest economic crisis is going to alter the class demographics of the country in irreversible ways. Those who belong to the lower middle class will likely fall into poverty and the poor will become desperately poor.Political and economic chaosOnly those in the middle or upper middle class who survive on remittances will manage to hold on for a while, but their investments in property or other Pakistani assets are likely to be devalued as Pakistani currency loses more and more value, despite making short-term recoveries. All of this will mean dependence on the black market for medicines and any kind of goods that are not manufactured in Pakistan using Pakistani materials. In fact, it is unfortunate that very little is manufactured in Pakistan from purely indigenous material.Many analysts have sounded the alarm in recent months over the country’s dire political and economic situation. Not only have the warnings and assessments of these analysts been ignored but the crisis has exacerbated thanks to the ever-more reckless actions taken by existing government officials. The switchovers from one to another and then another set-up has made accountability elusive. The possibility of future accountability via elections also seems remote given the political instability that has been witnessed for several months now. This means that the country has fallen into a state where people are doing whatever they can and get away with breaking the rules. For those who follow the rules, pay taxes, vote and hope for a democratic country run based on laws, this is terrible news.The only class of Pakistanis that have been untouched and will remain untouched by the hell that has descended upon the people are the rich and the ultra-rich. With all their assets safely stowed away in Dubai or some similar financial haven, they can talk about the current circumstances as if they were just another topic for an after-dinner conversation.As things become worse and worse, these people will leave for their offshore havens, so the poor who have nothing left to lose cannot come after them. Meanwhile, innocent, honest, good and worthy Pakistanis will die because they believed in a country that did not believe in them.The column first appeared in the Dawn on September 20.

       " 'KOLKATA: A 60% surplus rainfall in September in Kolkata, combined with fresh weather systems over the Bay of Bengal, is making up for the rain deficiency of the past three months. Local meteorologists expect a delayed monsoon withdrawal across Bengal, which could be a dampener on Durga Puja festivities. Monsoon usually retreats across rest of India on September 17 but lingers in Bengal till October 10.\"During a weak monsoon, like this year\\'s, there is usually intense localised rainfall in the late monsoon period,\" said G K Das, director, Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). \"For the last few years, weak monsoons have resulted in a September surplus, which carries over into the following month. It is possible that monsoon this year may retreat by or after October 20, coinciding with Durga Puja festivities,\" he added.The delayed exit of this year\\'s monsoon is not only limited to Bengal. Earlier this week, Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, the director general of meteorology, India Meteorological Department (IMD), said monsoon withdrawal was \"going to be delayed,\" adding, \"We can see new circulations and low-pressure areas over many parts of the country, so there are no symptoms of monsoon withdrawal at this stage.\"According to the RMC\\'s monsoon reports, monsoon retreat for the whole country has been increasingly delayed in the last few years. Between 2017 and 2020, the withdrawal date has been pushed back by as much as 22 days.The weak monsoon in Bengal has resulted in an unusual distribution of September rainfall, with Kolkata receiving a 60% surplus against its normal count of 318mm while the rest of south Bengal got near-normal rain.The delayed withdrawal, coupled with the frequent formation of Bay of Bengal weather systems in September, are likely to help make up for the three months of rain deficiency. Kolkata had a 10% rain deficit in August, 60% in July and 38% in June. Despite fears of dampening Durga Puja festivities, a delayed monsoon withdrawal is likely to keep temperatures low and skies overcast for most of October.',\n",

       " 'India’s Chandrayaan 3 mission was a huge success as the country’s lunar probe became the first to land on the south pole of the Moon in August. With this mission, India also joined the ‘elite’ club of four countries that have successfully landed their spacecraft on Earth’s natural satellite. After conducting experiments on the moon from August 23 to September 4, the Vikram lander and the Pragyan rover were put to sleep. This was done for the lander and the rover modules to survive the extremely frigid atmosphere at the south pole of the moon.Now, Chandrayaan 3’s lander and rover modules are set to wake up from sleep to continue their mission. And, ISRO scientists are eagerly waiting for the Vikram lander and the Pragyan rover to wake up from the 14-day sleep during the lunar night. The government has informed that the lander and the rover are awaiting the wake-up call to get reactivated.What the government said about waking up Chandrayaan 3Responding to a discussion on the Chandrayaan-3 lunar mission in the lower house of Parliament, Lok Sabha, Union Minister of Science and Technology, Jitendra Singh said: \"All efforts are being made to awaken Vikram and Pragyan from their sleep. When we sleep on earth, Vikram and Pragyan will perhaps wake up on the moon.\"Untitled Carousel According to a report by PTI, Singh also mentioned that the solar batteries of the instruments have been charged fully. Scientists are waiting for the temperature on the lunar surface to rise for the wake-up call to be communicated to Vikram and Pragyan, he added.Singh noted: \"Team ISRO is waiting for sunrise near the south pole of the moon and the temperatures to rise.”What ISRO said about waking up Chandrayaan 3In a statement , ISRO chairman S Somanath said: “It would have been easy if there was a way we could know if they would wake up, but we have to wait and see how systems behave after Sunrise\".He noted that if the systems survived the night and they were able to wake up again, that process would happen automatically.Both Vikram and Pragyan have achieved their primary mission objectives. It included soft-landing on the Moon, roving on its surface and conducting on-site experiments. Moreover, Vikram even performed a short lunar hop which wasn’t included in the initial mission objectives, ISRO said.',\n",
       " 'TORONTO: Canada\\'s allegations of India\\'s involvement in the killing of a Sikh separatist in Surrey that sparked a diplomatic row between the two nations are based on both human and signals intelligence and inputs from an ally from Ottawa\\'s Five Eye intelligence network, a media report has said citing the Canadian government sources.Tensions flared between India and Canada early this week following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\\'s explosive allegations of the \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on his country\\'s soil on June 18 in British Columbia. India had designated Nijjar as a terrorist in 2020.India angrily rejected the allegations as \"absurd\" and \"motivated\" and expelled a senior Canadian diplomat in a tit-for-tat move to Ottawa\\'s expulsion of an Indian official over the case.The Canadian government has amassed both human and signals intelligence in a months-long investigation of the Sikh man\\'s death that has inflamed relations with India, CBC News, a division of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, reported on Thursday quoting sources.That intelligence includes communications involving Indian officials themselves, including Indian diplomats present in Canada, say Canadian government sources.The intelligence did not come solely from Canada. Some were provided by an unnamed ally in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, the public broadcaster said.Canada is part of a ‘Five Eyes\\' network which is an intelligence alliance consisting of the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The report said the diplomatic crisis unfolded progressively behind the scenes. Canadian officials went to India on several occasions seeking cooperation in the investigation of Nijjar\\'s death, the report claimed.Canada\\'s National Security and Intelligence Adviser Jody Thomas was in India over four days in mid-August, then again for five days in September. That last visit overlapped with a tense meeting between Prime Minister Trudeau and Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, it said.\"Canadian sources say that when pressed behind closed doors, no Indian official has denied the bombshell allegation at the core of this case — that there is evidence to suggest Indian government involvement in the assassination of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil,\" it added.Canada is weighing retaliation but has taken no decision yet, said government sources in Ottawa.On Thursday, India asked Canada to come down hard on terrorists and anti-India elements operating from its soil and suspended visa services for Canadians, as escalating tensions between the two nations over the killing of Nijjar pushed their ties to an all-time low.India also asked Canada to downsize its diplomatic staff in the country, arguing that there should be parity in strength and rank equivalence in the mutual diplomatic presence. The size of Canadian diplomatic staff in India is larger than what New Delhi has in Canada.When asked about the intelligence reports, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said she couldn\\'t comment without risking the investigation and Canada\\'s obligations to its Five Eyes partners.\"That partnership rests very much on those… intelligence conversations being held in confidence,\" she told CBC News Network.Asked if Canada is thinking about retaliating by pausing visa processing for Indian visitors, Freeland said the government is focused on bringing the killers to justice.\"This is not about geopolitics. This is about Canada and the safety of Canadians in Canada. This is about the rule of law,\" she said.Prime Minister Trudeau Thursday said Canada is not looking to \"provoke or cause problems\" with India as he urged New Delhi to take the matter \"extremely seriously\" and work with Ottawa to \"uncover the truth\".\"We call upon the government of India to take seriously this matter and to work with us to shed full transparency and ensure accountability and justice in this matter,\" Trudeau said while responding to questions on the diplomatic row between India and Canada.\"We are a country of the rule of law. We are going to continue to do the work necessary to keep Canadians safe and to uphold our values and the international rules-based order. That\\'s our focus right now,\" added Trudeau, who is here to attend the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.When asked whether his government would take any retaliatory measures following India\\'s suspension of visa services for Canadians, Trudeau said that his government was not looking to provoke or cause problems.The Canadian government has not released its evidence and has suggested it could emerge during an eventual legal process, the CBC report said.The US on Thursday said it supports Canada\\'s efforts to investigate allegations of India\\'s involvement in the killing of Nijjar, observing that no country can get any \"special exemption\" for such kind of activities.The US government has not confirmed or denied that it was the Five Eyes ally providing some of the signals intelligence.But National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters at a White House news conference that the United States has been in frequent contact with Canada on this issue.“I\\'m not going to get into the substance of private diplomatic conversations, but we are in constant contact with our Canadian counterparts. We are consulting with them closely. We support the efforts that they are undertaking in this investigation and we have also been in touch with the Indian government as well,” he said.\"We have deep concerns about the allegations and we would like to see this investigation carried forward and the perpetrators held to account. That is what the US has stood for from the moment this emerged in public and we will continue to stand for that until this fully plays its way out,” he said.Refusing to respond to questions on the evidence of Canadian allegations, Sullivan said he is not going to speak to either intelligence or law enforcement matters from this podium.“I will let that process play out. We are in, as I said before, continuous communication and consultation with the Canadian government and we will remain so as we go forward,” he said.',\n",

Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam is not a normal law, this is the proclamation of new democratic commitment of new India.There were many obstacles in the way of this women's reservation bill. But When intentions are pure and there is transparency in attempts, then we witness results overcoming all obstacles. It is a record in itself that this bill got so much support in Parliament. I thank all political parties and MPs for it.Some decisions have the capability to change the country's future and we are witness to one such decision. India has made history on September 20-21. It is our good fortune that people gave us chance to do so. I congratulate all women of the country. Yesterday and the day before, we witnessed the making of a new history. It is our fortune that crores of people gave us the opportunity to create that history.Our govt made every attempt to unshackle women with schemes for their security, respect, prosperity.BJP was making efforts for the last three decades to ensure women's participation in democracy through this law. This was our commitment, and today, we have fulfilled it.This law has proved that a full-majority government, a strong government, a decisive government is a must to take the nation forward.We formed law to stop the ill practice of triple talaq, which caused atrocities on women. Crores of Muslim women have gotten rid of the inhuman practice of triple talaq. When an absolute majority of government came to power in the country, such a huge work could be completed. We did not let anyone's selfishness become a wall before women's reservation. People did vote for the Bill but a few people felt uneasy about why have the words 'Nari Shakti Vandan' been brought. Shouldn't the women of the country be given salutations? Should there be so much arrogance in men and our political ideology that we are unhappy over 'Nari Shakti Vandan'?Earlier on Friday, PM Modi was given a rousing welcome and felicitated by BJP's Mahila Morcha members.

       " \"NOIDA: To ease traffic congestion in bustling Bengaluru, the Karnataka government has been advised to impose a congestion tax on vehicles entering the city through high-density roads during peak hours.What is congestion tax?Congestion tax is a system of charging vehicles to enter certain areas of a city during peak hours. It is a popular tool to reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. It can also help to strengthen public transportation by encouraging people to switch from private vehicles.Is congestion tax a good idea for Bengaluru?Experts say congestion tax is a good idea for Bengaluru. The city is struggling with severe traffic congestion, and a congestion tax could help to reduce the number of private vehicles on the road. This would make it faster and easier for everyone to get around, and it would also improve air quality.How congestion tax will help Bengaluru?BMTC officials believe that a congestion tax in high-density corridors would discourage private vehicles and encourage public transport, as it would make driving more expensive and public transport more attractive.How Bengaluru is planning to collect congestion tax?FASTag, which has been successfully implemented here since 2021, could be used to collect congestion tax for ease and convenience. Toll machines would be placed at major access points to busy areas, and vehicles would be photographed with cameras as they cross the toll points. The congestion tax would then be automatically deducted from the vehicle owner's bank account.Has congestion tax system been implemented in any other Indian city?No. Similar proposals for congestion taxes in New Delhi and Mumbai failed in the past, largely due to political opposition and lobbying from the private car industry.What are the high-density corridors in Bengaluru?The high-density corridors in the city include Outer Ring Road, Sarjapur Road, Hosur Road, Old Airport Road, Old Madras Road, Ballari Road, Bannerghatta Road, Kanakapura Road, Magadi Road, West of Chord Road and Tumakuru Road.Which major world cities have congestion tax system?Singapore, London, and Stockholm are all examples of cities that have successfully implemented congestion pricing.Singapore: Singapore's congestion pricing system is fully automated and uses variable charges depending on the time of day and the specific area of the city.London: In London, vehicles entering central London during business hours on weekdays have to pay a charge.Stockholm: In Stockholm, there is a tax on vehicles entering the city on weekdays during the day.\",\n",

Once the Parel plot is redeveloped, it could mirror other former mill properties in the area that now house corporate offices, eateries and high-end stores.Many city planners have criticised the transformation of the area as being haphazard, lacking in a comprehensive urban planning vision and failing to address infrastructural needs.While the Parel deal is touted as the most expensive deal in Mumbai, Brookfield Asset Management had bought offices and retail space in Powai from the Hiranandani Group for ₹6,700 crore in 2016. However, that deal in the northeastern suburb of Mumbai was for finished buildings, while the property in Parel is barren.Office rentals in Mumbai are the costliest in the country with the rent paid per sq ft of office space far higher than other cities. While a report by property consultants Anarock says the business district of Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) in Mumbai has the highest monthly rental, office space in Parel is a close second. !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r]]>Tokyo-headquartered Sumitomo invests globally in development and operations of office buildings, retail facilities and residences. The firm is also no stranger to big-ticket investments in Mumbai realty.In 2019, it bought a three-acre plot in BKC for ₹2,238 crore. At the time, it paid ₹745 crore per acre, which was the most anyone had paid for land in the country for an 80-year lease. Construction has begun on the site but it’s not clear what is being developed.In 2022, Sumitomo bid successfully to lease two commercial plots in BKC at ₹2,067 crore for a period of 80 years.In the case of the Parel property, it is believed that Sumitomo can develop up to 5mn sq ft of space that it can then sell or lease.Development plans“Considering the minimum potential of the land, it can get an FSI [floor space index] of five, which indicates that Sumitomo will be taking an integrated approach of using the land for a variety of development,” says Pankaj Kapoor, founder of Liases Foras, a real estate research firm.Kapoor says having a foreign entity involved in the project makes it viable as the cost of capital is lower than for an Indian company. However, he sees the sale of the developed property taking longer.“Since this is a high-cost project, the sales velocity will also be slower and I anticipate it will take around 12-15 years for it to be sold out,” says Kapoor.Given the limited land in the island city, demand has always exceeded supply in Mumbai. Areas in central Mumbai have seen multiple high-value deals for both residential and office space. “Land comes at a high premium in the landlocked city. There is also a gentrification and rejuvenation of areas in central Mumbai as south Mumbai is saturated,” says Kapoor.Town planner Sashikant Dave says land is being ‘recycled’ in Mumbai and with demand for luxury houses rising, prices won’t cool for residential or office spaces.“There are many from the families in suburbs who now want to shift to areas in central Mumbai as they are able to afford bigger houses that are close to their workspaces or with an aspiration to give their children better facilities,” says Dave.He says real estate thrives in Mumbai due to the high purchasing power of the people in the city and the desire to upgrade.“People living in a 1 BHK [bedroom, hall and kitchen] want to move to a 2BHK and so on. And with this, companies are willing to invest a huge price to enter the Mumbai market,” says Dave.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: To boost last-mile connectivity, Delhi government will soon launch a sharing system for e-scooters and e-cycles in Dwarka sub-city. Under this, 3,000 electric vehicles will be deployed at 90 high-footfall locations, such as metro stations, bus depots, markets, malls and educational institutions, in three phases. The move is aimed at providing cost-effective and eco-friendly mobility solutions to the city\\'s residents. The first phase is likely to be rolled out in six months.Launching the project, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said it was a \"significant step forward in our mission to enhance the urban mobility experience and last-mile connectivity in Delhi\".\"Under the visionary leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, we will introduce a public e-scooter sharing (PeSS) system and a public e-cycle sharing system (PeCS) in Dwarka sub-city,\" he said, adding, \"We have invited proposals from potential service providers for the deployment of high- and low-speed e-scooters and e-cycles.\"While 1,500 vehicles will be launched in the first phase, the second phase will introduce 750 vehicles and Phase 3 will add another 750 vehicles, on the condition that they are offered for long-term hire or rental.

       " 'Ganesh Chaturthi was celebrated yesterday with gusto and social media was abuzz with celebs getting Bappa home and doing the puja. While many actors chose to have grand celebrations, actor couple Rohit Roy and Manasi Joshi Roy opted for a quiet celebration, spending time with Bappa alone.Rohit, who also posted a picture of his eco-friendly Ganpati on his social media, said, \"While everyone has their perception of celebrating Ganesh festival, this year I wanted it to be different. The entire Ganesh Chaturthi festivities were initiated by Lokmanya Tilak because he wanted people to come together at pandals and celebrate the festival. But over the years, I feel that the entire idea or meaning of getting Bappa home and celebrating the festival is getting lost somewhere. After 2015, I wasn\\'t getting Bappa home. I had many thoughts in my mind of how I wanted to celebrate the festival. Last year Jackie Shroff had got Bappa home and was sitting quietly with him. He had posted a picture of him on his social media and somehow I connected with it. There were no people around him, it was just him celebrating with Ganesha. I also had similar thoughts in mind and coincidentally Manasi also wanted to celebrate Ganesh festival quietly without any socialising. And so this year, we finally got an eco-friendly Ganesh home and I have not invited anyone. I wanted to meditate, spend time with my Gannuji, offer prasad and enjoy my celebration quietly without any pomp and noise. I told my friends that they are free to come, but I am not inviting anyone.\"Rohit added, \"I am not against people celebrating and getting together at each other\\'s homes. Even my brother and actor Rohit gets Bappa home and all our relatives and friends get together. My mother is also mostly there because she has to welcome her friends. This year, I wanted to keep it simple, quiet and wanted my time to reflect on my life and spend my time with God. I would like to reiterate that pandal hopping and socialising is not bad, but I am enjoying this quiet celebration with my wife at home. Ronit also visited some time back and my wife is shooting for her show. So I am spending my alone time with Ganeshji at home.\"The actor also shared how there are many festivals after this in the coming months to socialise. He said, \"After Ganeshji\\'s festival, there\\'s Navratri, Diwali, Durga Puja and we will get ample opportunities to socialise and meet people. So, I wanted to celebrate the festival without any extravagance.\"',\n",
       " \"NEW DELHI: There has been a slow but steady rise in support for both Indian-American presidential candidates- entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley-among the Republican primary voters.In the latest polls for the crucial early primary state of New Hampshire, Ramaswamy and Haley are enjoying more support than Florida governor Ron DeSantis from Republican voters.As per the CNN/University of New Hampshire poll, Trump, who has been indicted four times since April this year and faces 91 criminal charges, remains the top choice of 39 per cent of likely GOP primary voters in this first-in-the-nation primary state.Then, Ramaswamy is in second place with 13 per cent support, followed closely by Haley at 12 per cent and former New Jersey governor Chris Christie at 11 per cent, according to CNN's report. Ron DeSantis has slipped to the 5th position.Ramaswamy's surge in support is primarily centered on individuals who are not affiliated with the Republican Party, showing a remarkable increase of 16 points since July within this demographic, while his backing among registered Republicans has remained relatively stable. Additionally, his popularity has seen substantial growth among younger prospective voters, with a significant 28-point increase among those under the age of 35, and an 11-point rise among those aged 35 to 49. Meanwhile, his support has remained relatively consistent among individuals aged 50 or older.Haley's increase in support is somewhat more pronounced among individuals with higher levels of formal education, showing an 11-point increase among those who have completed some postgraduate work and a 15-point increase among other college graduates. She has also gained 18 points of support among moderates, while her support among conservatives has remained relatively steady since July.Both Ramaswamy and Haley have seen their support grow since the first presidential Republican debate, which was held in Wisconsin last month. The leading Republican contender Trump did not take part in the debate.The second Republican debate is set to take place in California next week. Trump is again set to give a miss to the debate.\",\n",
       " 'A day after promising to “defend democracy,” US President Joe Biden brought up India and Saudi Arabia on September 20 during a round of meetings at the United Nations — not to raise concerns about repression by either, but to hail them for helping establish a new economic corridor. “I think it’s a big deal,” he said.Perhaps no two countries reflect the difficult and delicate trade-offs in Biden’s foreign policy at the moment more than India and Saudi Arabia. He has made it a priority to court both nations as part of his effort to counter Russia and China, even as India has been backsliding in its democracy and Saudi Arabia never had one to begin with.The news of the week illustrated just how acute that tension really is. India’s government was accused of orchestrating the assassination of a political opponent on Canadian soil, leaving Biden caught between one of America’s oldest friends and the newer friend he has been cultivating. And word emerged that Biden’s envoys are negotiating a new defence treaty with Saudi Arabia, putting aside its own history of extraterritorial killing.US stanceWhile Biden did not address either subject, the White House responded to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s accusations against India on September 20 with studied judiciousness. John Kirby, a spokesperson for Biden’s National Security Council, pronounced the administration “deeply concerned” about the allegations and said that “the facts should take the investigators where they may and that the perpetrators of this attack need to be brought to justice”. Canada&#39;s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#39;s remarks in Parliament today on credible allegations that India&#39;s government may have had links to the assassination in Canada of a Canadian-Sikh activist. pic.twitter.com/KlCPDLS7rt Bhupinder S Liddar (@Pohir) September 19, 2023 ]]>But he emphasised American ties with India. “I can just tell you that our relationship with India remains vitally important not only for the South Asian region but of course for the Indo-Pacific,” Kirby told reporters. Then, shortly after the briefing, the council emailed a statement from another spokesperson, Adrienne Watson, saying: “Targeting dissidents in other countries is absolutely unacceptable and we will keep taking steps to push back on this practice.”The killing in Canada spawned second-guessing about Biden’s outreach to India at a time when he has increasingly prioritized bolstering partnerships over full-throated advocacy for democracy. He just visited India this month and on the way back stopped in Hanoi to cement a strategic relationship with Vietnam, a one-party Communist-run state, with barely a mention of repression there. His administration just signed a new security and economic agreement with Bahrain, a tightly controlled monarchy. And last week, it approved $235mn in military aid for Egypt that had been frozen for two years over human rights issues.“They talk a lot about the importance of democracy,” Sarah Margon, who was Biden’s original nominee for assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labour, said in an interview on September 20. “There are important initiatives that have developed to support democracy. But when push comes to shove, what we’re seeing is that supporting and sustaining democracy does not reach the same level of other geopolitical concerns.” Biden, who has called the “battle between democracy and autocracy” the defining struggle of this era, has lately been moving away from that framing. While he used some version of that wording 11 times last year, he has only done so four times this year and not in the past two months, according to a search of Factba.se, a service that records presidential statements.US building alliancesDuring his annual address to the United Nations General Assembly on September 19, Biden did not use the democracy-versus-autocracy phrase, as he had in his speech at the world forum a year ago. And rather than casting the war in Ukraine as a battle for democracy, he talked about it in terms of sovereignty, territorial integrity and freedom from foreign domination.His main reference to democracy in the speech on September 19 came in condemning a series of recent coups in Africa. “We will defend democracy — our best tool to meet the challenges we face around the world”, he said. “And we’re working to show how democracy can deliver in ways that matter to people’s lives.”Even some of his own advisers have long considered the black-and-white dichotomy too simplistic and diplomatically confining, particularly at a time when Biden has focused on building alliances to resist aggression by Russia and China. In effect, he has concluded that he needs the help of some real or budding autocrats to battle bigger, more dangerous autocrats. If that means making nice with India and Saudi Arabia, among others, so be it.The furor in Canada over the shooting of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh community leader, in British Columbia in June feels like an eerie echo of the Saudi-orchestrated assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and journalist living in the United States, at the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul in 2018. In both cases, a government considered an American friend was accused of carrying out the killing of a critic on the soil of a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) ally. Trudeau blamed “agents of the government of India” for the shooting and expelled an Indian diplomat described as the head of New Delhi’s intelligence agency in Canada. India has called Nijjar, who advocated the creation of a Sikh state out of Indian territory, a wanted terrorist, but has denied Trudeau’s accusation and expelled a Canadian diplomat in response.In the past, the United States has joined allies in retaliating against adversaries plotting to murder opponents sheltered in their countries. President Donald Trump expelled 60 Russian diplomats in 2018 after agents from Moscow used a nerve agent to try to kill Sergei Skripal, a dissident former Russian intelligence officer, on British soil (although Trump later expressed anger to aides over being talked into doing so).Unlike Saudi Arabia or Russia, India has long been a thriving democracy with diverse and robust points of view debated in Parliament and the media. China, Russia factorThe negotiation of a possible mutual defence treaty with Saudi Arabia resembling military pacts with Japan and South Korea comes amid a broader effort to transform America’s relationship with the kingdom. Biden hopes to broker a deal to normalise relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants a stronger security commitment from Washington as part of any arrangement.Crown Prince Mohammed suggested on September 20 that progress was being made toward normalisation. “Every day we get closer,” he told Fox News. The topic was also a big part of a meeting held by Biden with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who likewise offered an optimistic forecast for “a historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia,” as he termed it. “This is something within our reach,” the Israeli leader told reporters.The notion of drawing closer to Riyadh belied Biden’s 2020 campaign promise to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” because of the murder of Khashoggi, who was killed and dismembered, according to the CIA, on the orders of Crown Prince Mohammed, often called MBS. Biden shared a friendly handshake in a brief conversation with Crown Prince Mohammed on the sideline of the recent G20 meeting in New Delhi, abandoning the more distant fist-bump the president opted for while visiting Jeddah a year earlier.As with India, Vietnam and other countries Biden has sought to bolster relations with, the subtext of the move to strengthen ties with Saudi Arabia is China and Russia. The Biden administration wants not only to bring an end to generations of conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbours but also to anchor the oil-producing kingdom more firmly in America’s orbit.',\n",

       " 'In Bollywood, being open about your sexual needs, having intimate relationships, coupled with vices like drinking and smoking (please note that we are calling them vices) has largely been portrayed as a Mumbai/Delhi thing. On the other hand, smaller, Tier II cities (read Lucknow, Nagpur, Jaipur etc) have been relegated to an awkward looking couple exchanging shy glances, secretly meeting at faraway parks, and then turning into quintessential laila majnus when their conservative families catch a whiff of their affair and all hell breaks loose. This is where Maneesh Sharma\\'s Shuddh Desi Romance (2013) broke the mould, shattering the notion that small town millennials (especially girls) can also be open about sexuality and body needs. Though Jaipur, where the movie is set, is a state capital, the Tier II city has hardly ever been explored this way in Bollywood, with filmmakers struggling to go beyond its cliched padharo mhare desh mein narrative. Most importantly, apart from a brilliantly shot Gulabi, some spectacular shots of the Pink City, and mannerisms of a certain Marwari businessman Goyal ji (played fabulously by the late Rishi Kapoor), you can place these characters in any smaller town and the plot would still hold water.Gayatri (Parineeti Chopra), a 20 something young, brash and unfiltered girl, lives solo in Jaipur and apart from studying, poses as a fake wedding guest (employed by Goyal ji) at baraat parties to earn cash on the side. On one such occasion, she hops on a bus, but starts making out with the groom himself, who turns out to be tourist guide Raghu (Sushant Singh Rajput). Lured by their sizzling chemistry, Raghu runs away from the mandap, even as the jilted bride Tara (Vaani Kapoor) seems quite unperturbed by the whole scenario and later, plays a crucial part in the story. Coming back to Gayatri and Raghu, their romance brims faster than instant coffee, as Raghu\\'s quickly moves into Gayatri\\'s modest terrace barsaati and their days are marked by cooking meals, (sometimes) going to work, taking a drag in the balcony and multiple bedroom romps. Of course, it is all fun and games, viewed through rose tinted glasses of young love, till they both think it could be something more. On Diwali night, in a drunken stupor, the two decide to get married, but karma comes to bite Raghu in the a** as this time, the commitment phobic Gayatri runs away from the mandap!A few months later, Raghu bumps into Tara and the two start dating, with all seeming hunky dory, that is, until Gayatri makes a surprise re-entry to his life...Maneesh Sharma, who had earlier helmed movies like Band Baaja Baaraat and Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, seems to have a knack for peeping deep into millennial psyche and how they think and function. Raghu and Gayatri, though good at heart, are indecisive, and mostly live life on the edge. While they mean no harm and are never a hindrance in anyone else\\'s life, they often can become fodder for gossip - just like the guy Raghu bumps into while buying ciggies at the local panwari, who unabashedly shames Gayatri for having a \\'lot of boyfriends\\', without batting an eyelid for Raghu, who too, is part of the relationship. Surprisingly, the good hearted and jovial Goyal ji, remains largely non-judgemental towards the young lovers, but ends up unconsciously slipping personal details about the two to each other, only to nonchalantly declare, \\'dusre ke maamle mein hume kya bolna\\' (why to intervene in someone else\\'s life) in the end. Soon after Gayatri, Raghu finds solace in the arms of Tara, but their relationship, though slightly more stable, is neither serious nor long run. And somewhere, the commitment apart, Raghu\\'s heart still pines for Gayatri and the two decide to give their love another chance.... Live-in relationships, though not for everyone, are more prevalent in today\\'s society than ever. The movie however, does not either berate, nor supports the institution, and Maneesh consciously paints all three leads as deeply flawed, who in no way, should be seen as a benchmark for millenial decisions (we are better than this right?). The movie rather drives home the message that relationships are complicated and what works for one might not work for someone else and that is perfectly okay. As human beings, we all are wired differently and it is okay to not think of marriage as the \\'end goal\\' of any relationship.As Gayatri tells Raghu in the end that marriage is not an option for her for now at least, it is completely fine to not feel ready, now or ever.As the lead stars perfectly sum it up in the title track, \"jhoothe samajo se, jhoothe rivaajo so, liye hi jaaye koi chance\", (let\\'s break away from these hollow rituals and societal pressures) maybe love, the sugar-coated superlatives apart, can best be described as an institution that should be \\'to each its own\\'....You can watch Shuddh Desi Romance on a leading OTT channel...ETimes Decoded is our new, weekly column where we deconstruct movies, characters or plots to uncover a fresh, often undiscovered perspective.',\n",

A crucial factor in identifying the potential Nipah cases with this is travel history to Nipah-affected areas, particularly Kerala, Northeast India, or areas adjacent to Bangladesh. When such cases are identified, they should be admitted to isolation wards, and their samples must be sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for thorough testing,\" he said.The state public health department has asked healthcare professionals to strictly adhere to the universal precautions recommended by the World Health Organisation while treating Nipah patients. \"To reduce the risk of exposure to the virus, it is advisable to avoid consuming fruits that have fallen in forests or on open fields,\" Saranikar said.Dr Sanjay Pujari, the director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases, said, \"Surveillance to identify spillover from bats to humans need to be done and containment measures must be implemented if an impending outbreak is suspected.\"',\n",

The registrations stood at 2.5 lakh last year. The test is scheduled on November 26.According to CAT 2023 convener Prof Sanjeet Singh from IIM-Lucknow, the organising institute for the test this year, there is a record increase of 30% in the applications in one year. The rise was 11% in 2022.\"The registrations are highest in history of CAT, ever since it was started in 1977. In absolute numbers, an increase of 75,000 applications, year-on-year, is a record,\" Singh told TOI.Female registrations see a 3% increase in CAT this yearThe high numbers, said experts, reflect sustained interest students have in the field of management and in IIMs. \"I believe increased publicity about CAT on social media platforms and adding more test cities with increase in exam centres, particularly in tier-II cities, have resulted in this highest-ever registrations,\" said Prof Singh. Of the total 3.3 lakh, 1.17 lakh, or 38%, are female. There has been a 3% increase in female registrations. Over the past decade, IIMs have taken multiple steps to increase gender diversity in management education. Consequently, IIMs have anywhere between 30% and 45% female students on their campuses. Till 2008, CAT was a pen and-paper test. This year, 2.9 lakh applicants had registered, which was the previous highest number of registernations. \"The first computer-based test was held in 2009,\" said Prof Singh. After this, the numbers dipped and rose gradually. While 2.41 lakh registered themselves in 2019, the number dipped in 2020 to 2.28, when the first wave of Covid-19 hit the world- .CAT 2023 will be a computer-based test of 120 minutes.

       " 'Actor Paras Chhabra’s relationship with ex Akanksha Puri might be long over but the two made news sometime back. When Akanksha entered Bigg Boss OTT Season 2, she, during a conversation had hinted about not getting closure in her relationship with Paras. Ask him about that and he says, “Why does Akanksha Puri need a closure from me? Yes, I did get a lot of clips about that episode of Akanksha from my fans and friends. Our relationship was over three-four years back and it is done and dusted. Waise toh I do not intend to talk about my exes, especially Akanksha Puri, since everything is over from my side, but since once again the topic was raised and a lot of people were inquisitive to know my side of the story, I chose to reply. I am surprised that after becoming the winner of a show like Swayamvar: Mika Di Vohti she is still talking about me. Interestingly, not many people know that the red shoes that Akanksha had gifted to me when I was in the Bigg Boss 13 house and she had claimed them to be worth 80 thousand, were actually a collab-shoe made by some random guy. And he asked me for Rs 2100 for them after I came out of the BB house. They were not original but the first copy of a brand. So in short, contrary to her claims, she has never ever spent a penny on me from her pocket when we were in a relationship.” He adds, “According to me, she has been quite manipulative. Even on Bigg Boss OTT, she initially said she didn’t want to get close to Jad Hadid and later she kissed him only. She has been using my name and our past on shows and interviews but I want to end this chapter now. I am enjoying my single status a lot. From 2010, I have been in relationships till 2023, of course with different girls. And now when I do not have anyone in my life, I love this feeling. I am able to make friends and have so much fun.

       " 'India and Canada are locked in a heated row over Ottawa\\'s claim it has \"credible allegations\" linking agents of New Delhi to the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a pro-Khalistan terrorist. India has rejected the allegation and termed it as \"absurd\" and \"motivated\". But however absurd the claims may be, they’ve had tremendous repercussions with both countries expelling senior diplomats and issuing travel advisories. Now, it seems that India has suspended issuing visas to Canadian citizens \"till further notice\". Here are some of the more recent developments.Hindus asked to leave CanadaUS-based Sikh secessionist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun has branded Canadian Hindus disloyal and told them to go back to India.Pannun, general counsel of outlawed (in India) body Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), alleged that Canadian Hindus had campaigned against Canada after it had suspended trade with India over interference in its internal affairs. 🚨 Khalistani terrorist org &#39;Sikh for Justice&#39; (SFJ) has issued death threat for Hindus of Indian Origin in Canada and asked them to leave the country:Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun has released a fresh two-minute video from Canada threatening to attack Indian… pic.twitter.com/nDidsEVoTX OSINT Updates (@OsintUpdates) September 20, 2023 ]]> Accusing the Canadian Hindus of celebrating the assassination of Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) chief Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was shot dead in the parking lot of a gurdwara in Surrey in British Columbia, Pannun said: \"Canada has no place for those siding with India in suppressing the freedom of expression and promoting violence against pro-Khalistan Sikhs.\"Pannun had been designated as a terrorist by the Indian government in 2020.What happens to the students?Following Pannun’s rhetoric, families of Hindus from Punjab on Canadian study visas and work permits have started to worry.Though Punjabi Sikhs had started the trend of migration to Canada, for the last six years, Hindu families and students have also made a beeline for the IELTS centres and immigration offices. “Middle-class Hindus with easy loans and ready documents get there faster than Sikh families,” claimed an immigration agent from Bathinda. Amit Mittal, whose son is a student in Surrey, said: “Already, we were tense since the diplomatic fallout, and now they have asked Hindus to leave Canada for not condemning Nijjar’s killing. The Canadian government shouldn’t allow religious hatred, for the sake of its own image.”Barnala’s Satish Bansal, whose daughter also studies in Surrey, said: “We have a big study loan to pay off and a dilemma to deal with.”How was Nijjar killed?Whether or not Indians in Canada condemn Nijjar’s killing, it’s important that law enforcement authorities are allowed to do their job without political or geopolitical pressure. So far, we understand that Canadian law enforcement agencies have apparently zeroed in on two suspicious vehicles -- a burnt car and a silver 2008 Toyota Camry – and suspect that at least one of them was the getaway vehicle used by the assassins who shot Nijjar.This, sources have confirmed, was reminiscent of several gang-related killings in the area in the recent past. The development, coupled with Canadian media quoting Nijjar\\'s son saying that his father was regularly meeting with Canadian intelligence officers in the months before he was shot dead in British Columbia, has deepened the mystery and raised questions on the claims made by the Canadian PM Justin Trudeau. The modus operandi involving \"a car on fire\" was also seen in a recent targeted killing of a man named Gagandeep Sandhu (29) who was shot dead in his car in Burnaby. About 15 minutes after this murder, police were alerted about a vehicle burning at some distance from the crime scene. The police, however, did not confirm whether the killing and the burnt black Honda Pilot SUV were connected and said an investigation was underway.Reports have said that the initial investigation into the killing was a likely fallout of bloody feud between the rival groups of Khalistanis.NIA releases list of 43 criminals, many with Canada Khalistan linksTightening the screw on gangsters operating out of Canada, the National Investigation Agency (NIA), India’s counter-terror agency, has issued a list of 43 most-wanted criminals, many of them associated with terror-gangster networks linked to Canada or the Khalistan movement.Urging the public to share details of properties and assets of the criminals, the NIA issued pictures of Lawrence Bishnoi, Jasdeep Singh, Kala Jatheri alias Sandeep, Virender Pratap alias Kala Rana and Joginder Singh along with their names.It highlighted that many of these gangsters are based in Canada.

Hope traditional friends and partners can cooperate to get to the bottom of it,\" said Garcetti.The ambassador was responding to a question about how the US reconciled its call for India to facilitate the probe with India’s official position that the allegations made by Trudeau, who has sought India’s support to carry the investigations forward, were not just unsubstantiated but also absurd.Did Trudeau torpedo India’s reach out efforts? The Canadian government has torpedoed efforts by the Indian government to reach out to separatist Sikhs in Canada, bowing to pressure from extremist Khalistanis, a Canadian commentator has revealed. This comes amid growing scrutiny of Ottawa\\'s purported indulgence and patronage of militants.The Indian government\\'s outreach, according to columnist Terry Glavin in the National Post, came in 2016-17 when it sought the help of British Sikh activist Jasdev Singh Rai for talks with \"veteran Canadian Khalistanis who were growing weary of agitating for a separate Sikh state in India that India’s Sikhs want nothing to do with.\"Rai met the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service during several visits to Canada, but the Trudeau government bowed to a Khalistani-influenced group of gurudwara leaders and “obstructed the peace dialogue process,” Glavin quotes Rai as saying. Rai eventually found himself barred from Canada. Rai had not responded to requests for elaboration at the time of writing. The disclosure comes amid increasing scrutiny of what critics say is Trudeau\\'s double standard on issues of sovereignty and separatism, while accusing him of turning a blind eye to violent separatist Khalistanis operating openly in Canada.',\n",
       " 'Nasa\\'s inaugural mission to retrieve an asteroid sample and bring it back to US soil is poised for a dramatic conclusion this Sunday as it descends into the Utah desert.Launched in 2016, the US space probe OSIRIS-REx successfully gathered a sample from the asteroid Bennu almost three years ago. The touchdown is scheduled for Sunday at approximately at the Department of Defense\\'s Utah Test and Training Range. Four hours before landing, at a distance of about 67,000 miles (108,000 kilometers) from Earth, the Osiris-Rex probe will release a capsule containing the precious sample.The mission involved a high-risk operation in October 2020 when the probe made contact with the asteroid\\'s surface for a few seconds, emitting a burst of compressed nitrogen to stir up and capture the dust sample. Bennu surprised scientists by revealing a much lower density than anticipated when the probe\\'s arm sank into the soil during this brief contact. Consequently, Nasa may have collected up to 250 grams of material, exceeding the initial target of 60 grams. If confirmed, this would constitute the \"largest from beyond the orbit of the moon,\" Nasa program executive Melissa Morris told AFP.The final descent, lasting 13 minutes, will see the capsule hurtling through the atmosphere at speeds of around 27,000 miles (43,000 kilometers) per hour, reaching scorching temperatures of up to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,800 degrees Celsius), according to Nasa.If all goes according to plan, two successive parachutes will gently guide the capsule to a safe landing on the desert floor, where a prepared team will recover it. The challenge of hitting the target area, spanning 250 square miles (650 square kilometers), has been compared to \"throwing a dart across the length of a basketball court and hitting the bullseye.\"The night before the landing, controllers will have a final opportunity to abort the mission if conditions are unfavorable. In such a case, the probe would circle the Sun until its next attempt in 2025. Sandra Freund, Lockheed Martin\\'s OSIRIS-REx program manager, emphasized the complexity and potential pitfalls of sample return missions, stating, \"Sample return missions are hard. There\\'s a number of things that can go wrong.\"Extensive preparations have been made to safeguard the asteroid material, even in the event of a \"hard landing scenario,\" as Freund described it, to preserve the samples in their pristine state. A final dress rehearsal took place in August, involving the drop of a replica capsule from a helicopter.Upon touching down, a team will assess the capsule\\'s condition before placing it in a net, which will be airlifted by helicopter to a temporary \"clean room.\" The following day, the sample will be transported to a highly specialized laboratory at Nasa\\'s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.In the lab, scientists will meticulously open the capsule and isolate rock and dust fragments over several days. Some of the sample will be subjected to immediate study, while the remainder will be stored for future generations equipped with advanced technology, continuing a practice initiated during the Apollo missions to the Moon. Nasa is set to unveil its initial findings during a press conference on October 11.Here is a brief overview of the spacecraft and its mission:The Long Journey: The Osiris-Rex spacecraft embarked on its $1 billion mission in 2016. It reached Bennu in 2018 and spent two years meticulously studying the small, spinning asteroid, identifying the optimal spot for sample collection. Three years ago, the spacecraft used its 11-foot vacuum arm to make contact with the asteroid\\'s surface, grabbing dust and pebbles. The force exerted during this operation caused rocks to become wedged around the container\\'s rim. Although some samples drifted away into space, the team managed to secure the remaining material inside the capsule. The exact quantity will only be known when the container is opened.Asteroid Bennu: Discovered in 1999, Bennu is believed to be a remnant of a larger asteroid that collided with another celestial body. It measures barely one-third of a mile (half a kilometer) wide, approximately the height of the Empire State Building, and its surface is rugged and dark, covered in boulders. Bennu orbits the sun every 14 months while rotating every four hours.There is a slim chance (1 in 2,700) that Bennu could collide with Earth in 2182, potentially causing catastrophic consequences. Nasa has been exploring ways to alter the asteroid\\'s trajectory, and a deeper understanding of Bennu\\'s composition could prove invaluable in this regard.Game Day: Osiris-Rex will release the sample capsule from a distance of 63,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) roughly four hours before it is expected to land at the Defense Department\\'s Utah Test and Training Range on Sunday morning. The command for release will come from Lockheed Martin\\'s control center in Colorado. Following this, the mothership will veer away and embark on another asteroid exploration mission. The capsule, measuring nearly 3 feet wide (81 centimeters) and 1.6 feet tall (50 centimeters), will enter the atmosphere at a blistering speed of 27,650 mph (44,500 kph) during the final 13 minutes of descent. A main parachute will gradually slow it down for a gentle 11 mph (18 kph) touchdown. Once the area is deemed secure, a helicopter will transport the capsule to an improvised clean lab at the range. The next day, an aircraft will ferry the sealed container filled with rubble to Nasa\\'s Johnson Space Center in Houston. Nasa plans to livestream the touchdown, scheduled for around 10:55 a.m. EDT.Cleaner Than Clean: To avoid cross-contamination with other collections, a new lab at Johnson Space Center will exclusively handle the Bennu rubble, according to Nasa curator Kevin Righter. Building 31 already houses moon rocks from the Apollo missions of 1969 to 1972, comet dust, solar wind particles from prior missions, and Mars meteorites discovered in Antarctica. The asteroid samples will be manipulated inside nitrogen-purging gloveboxes by personnel wearing full clean room suits. Nasa intends to publicly unveil the treasures from Bennu on October 11.Asteroid Autumn: This fall, Nasa is celebrating \"Asteroid Autumn,\" with three significant asteroid missions reaching major milestones. Osiris-Rex\\'s touchdown will be followed by the launch of another asteroid probe named Psyche on October 5. Both the Nasa spacecraft and its target, a metal asteroid also named Psyche, share the same name. A month later, Nasa\\'s Lucy spacecraft will make its first encounter with an asteroid since its launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in 2021. On November 1, Lucy will pass by Dinkinesh in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, preparing for an unprecedented tour of the Trojans, swarms of asteroids shadowing Jupiter around the sun. Neither Psyche nor Lucy will collect samples, and Osiris-Rex\\'s next assignment is to explore the asteroid Apophis in 2029.Other Sample Returns: This marks Nasa\\'s third deep space sample return mission, excluding the hundreds of pounds (kilograms) of moon rocks collected by Apollo astronauts. The agency\\'s first robotic sample retrieval in 2004 ended in a mishap when the capsule containing solar wind particles crashed into the Utah desert and shattered, compromising the samples. Two years later, a U.S. capsule successfully delivered comet dust. Japan\\'s initial asteroid sample mission brought back microscopic grains from asteroid Itokawa in 2010, and its second mission yielded about 5 grams of material from asteroid Ryugu in 2020. The Soviet Union transported moon samples to Earth during the 1970s, and China returned lunar material in 2020.(With inputs from agencies)',\n",

       " \"NEW DELHI: Characterizing Canada as a sanctuary for terrorists, a label previously applied only to Pakistan, the Indian government took a significant step on Thursday by suspending visa processing services in the North American nation. This move came in response to threats from Khalistan forces, which hindered the ability of Indian diplomats to carry out their duties.Against the backdrop of a heated diplomatic dispute triggered by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations that India might have been linked to the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a pro-Khalistan activist and Canadian national, India also made the decision to suspend the e-visa facility for Canadian citizens.Here is an FAQs on India's visa suspension for Canadians:Why did India suspend visa services for Canadians?A: India suspended visa services for Canadians on September 21, 2023, citing security threats to its diplomatic missions in Canada. The move came after Canada accused India of allegedly being involved in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was shot dead in Surrey, B.C., on June 18, 2023. India has denied the allegation and expelled a Canadian diplomat in retaliation.Q: Who is affected by the suspension of visa services?A: All Canadian nationals who intend to visit India and do not have a valid visa are affected by the suspension of visa services. This includes tourists, students, business travellers, and others. The suspension also applies to Canadians in a third country who want to apply for an Indian visa.Q: What are the exemptions from the suspension of visa services?A: The suspension of visa services does not affect those who already have a valid Indian visa or an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card. OCI card holders are people of Indian origin who have acquired foreign citizenship. They can enter and stay in India indefinitely without a visa.Q: How long will the suspension of visa services last?A: There is no official announcement on how long the suspension of visa services will last. It depends on how the diplomatic row between India and Canada is resolved. Both countries have expressed their desire to maintain good relations and cooperate on various issues, such as trade, security, and climate change.Q: What are the alternatives for Canadians who want to visit India?A: Canadians who want to visit India and do not have a valid visa or an OCI card have limited options. They can try to apply for an emergency visa at the Indian High Commission in Ottawa or the Consulates General in Toronto and Vancouver. However, these visas are only granted for urgent and compelling reasons, such as death or serious illness of a family member in India. Another option is to wait until the suspension of visa services is lifted or travel to another country that does not require a visa for Canadians.Q: Can Indians with valid visas travel to Canada?A: Yes, Indians with valid visas can travel to Canada. There are no restrictions on Indian travelers to Canada or on those with valid Indian visas. However, India has issued a travel advisory asking Indian nationals, including students and citizens planning on traveling to Canada, to exercise caution. They have been advised to avoid travelling to regions and potential venues in Canada that have seen growing anti-India activities, such as protests by Sikh separatists.Q: Has Canada suspended processing of visas for Indians?A: No, Canada has not suspended processing of visas for Indians.\",\n",
       " 'Nasa\\'s inaugural mission to retrieve an asteroid sample and bring it back to US soil is poised for a dramatic conclusion this Sunday as it descends into the Utah desert.Launched in 2016, the US space probe OSIRIS-REx successfully gathered a sample from the asteroid Bennu almost three years ago. The touchdown is scheduled for Sunday at approximately at the Department of Defense\\'s Utah Test and Training Range. Four hours before landing, at a distance of about 67,000 miles (108,000 kilometers) from Earth, the Osiris-Rex probe will release a capsule containing the precious sample.The mission involved a high-risk operation in October 2020 when the probe made contact with the asteroid\\'s surface for a few seconds, emitting a burst of compressed nitrogen to stir up and capture the dust sample. Bennu surprised scientists by revealing a much lower density than anticipated when the probe\\'s arm sank into the soil during this brief contact. Consequently, Nasa may have collected up to 250 grams of material, exceeding the initial target of 60 grams. If confirmed, this would constitute the \"largest from beyond the orbit of the moon,\" Nasa program executive Melissa Morris told AFP.The final descent, lasting 13 minutes, will see the capsule hurtling through the atmosphere at speeds of around 27,000 miles (43,000 kilometers) per hour, reaching scorching temperatures of up to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,800 degrees Celsius), according to Nasa.If all goes according to plan, two successive parachutes will gently guide the capsule to a safe landing on the desert floor, where a prepared team will recover it. The challenge of hitting the target area, spanning 250 square miles (650 square kilometers), has been compared to \"throwing a dart across the length of a basketball court and hitting the bullseye.\"The night before the landing, controllers will have a final opportunity to abort the mission if conditions are unfavorable. In such a case, the probe would circle the Sun until its next attempt in 2025. Sandra Freund, Lockheed Martin\\'s OSIRIS-REx program manager, emphasized the complexity and potential pitfalls of sample return missions, stating, \"Sample return missions are hard. There\\'s a number of things that can go wrong.\"Extensive preparations have been made to safeguard the asteroid material, even in the event of a \"hard landing scenario,\" as Freund described it, to preserve the samples in their pristine state. A final dress rehearsal took place in August, involving the drop of a replica capsule from a helicopter.Upon touching down, a team will assess the capsule\\'s condition before placing it in a net, which will be airlifted by helicopter to a temporary \"clean room.\" The following day, the sample will be transported to a highly specialized laboratory at Nasa\\'s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.In the lab, scientists will meticulously open the capsule and isolate rock and dust fragments over several days. Some of the sample will be subjected to immediate study, while the remainder will be stored for future generations equipped with advanced technology, continuing a practice initiated during the Apollo missions to the Moon. Nasa is set to unveil its initial findings during a press conference on October 11.Here is a brief overview of the spacecraft and its mission:The Long Journey: The Osiris-Rex spacecraft embarked on its $1 billion mission in 2016. It reached Bennu in 2018 and spent two years meticulously studying the small, spinning asteroid, identifying the optimal spot for sample collection. Three years ago, the spacecraft used its 11-foot vacuum arm to make contact with the asteroid\\'s surface, grabbing dust and pebbles. The force exerted during this operation caused rocks to become wedged around the container\\'s rim. Although some samples drifted away into space, the team managed to secure the remaining material inside the capsule. The exact quantity will only be known when the container is opened.Asteroid Bennu: Discovered in 1999, Bennu is believed to be a remnant of a larger asteroid that collided with another celestial body. It measures barely one-third of a mile (half a kilometer) wide, approximately the height of the Empire State Building, and its surface is rugged and dark, covered in boulders. Bennu orbits the sun every 14 months while rotating every four hours.There is a slim chance (1 in 2,700) that Bennu could collide with Earth in 2182, potentially causing catastrophic consequences. Nasa has been exploring ways to alter the asteroid\\'s trajectory, and a deeper understanding of Bennu\\'s composition could prove invaluable in this regard.Game Day: Osiris-Rex will release the sample capsule from a distance of 63,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) roughly four hours before it is expected to land at the Defense Department\\'s Utah Test and Training Range on Sunday morning. The command for release will come from Lockheed Martin\\'s control center in Colorado. Following this, the mothership will veer away and embark on another asteroid exploration mission. The capsule, measuring nearly 3 feet wide (81 centimeters) and 1.6 feet tall (50 centimeters), will enter the atmosphere at a blistering speed of 27,650 mph (44,500 kph) during the final 13 minutes of descent. A main parachute will gradually slow it down for a gentle 11 mph (18 kph) touchdown. Once the area is deemed secure, a helicopter will transport the capsule to an improvised clean lab at the range. The next day, an aircraft will ferry the sealed container filled with rubble to Nasa\\'s Johnson Space Center in Houston. Nasa plans to livestream the touchdown, scheduled for around 10:55 a.m. EDT.Cleaner Than Clean: To avoid cross-contamination with other collections, a new lab at Johnson Space Center will exclusively handle the Bennu rubble, according to Nasa curator Kevin Righter. Building 31 already houses moon rocks from the Apollo missions of 1969 to 1972, comet dust, solar wind particles from prior missions, and Mars meteorites discovered in Antarctica. The asteroid samples will be manipulated inside nitrogen-purging gloveboxes by personnel wearing full clean room suits. Nasa intends to publicly unveil the treasures from Bennu on October 11.Asteroid Autumn: This fall, Nasa is celebrating \"Asteroid Autumn,\" with three significant asteroid missions reaching major milestones. Osiris-Rex\\'s touchdown will be followed by the launch of another asteroid probe named Psyche on October 5. Both the Nasa spacecraft and its target, a metal asteroid also named Psyche, share the same name. A month later, Nasa\\'s Lucy spacecraft will make its first encounter with an asteroid since its launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in 2021. On November 1, Lucy will pass by Dinkinesh in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, preparing for an unprecedented tour of the Trojans, swarms of asteroids shadowing Jupiter around the sun. Neither Psyche nor Lucy will collect samples, and Osiris-Rex\\'s next assignment is to explore the asteroid Apophis in 2029.Other Sample Returns: This marks Nasa\\'s third deep space sample return mission, excluding the hundreds of pounds (kilograms) of moon rocks collected by Apollo astronauts. The agency\\'s first robotic sample retrieval in 2004 ended in a mishap when the capsule containing solar wind particles crashed into the Utah desert and shattered, compromising the samples. Two years later, a U.S. capsule successfully delivered comet dust. Japan\\'s initial asteroid sample mission brought back microscopic grains from asteroid Itokawa in 2010, and its second mission yielded about 5 grams of material from asteroid Ryugu in 2020. The Soviet Union transported moon samples to Earth during the 1970s, and China returned lunar material in 2020.(With inputs from agencies)',\n",
       " 'Thousands of job seekers, including graduates from top-tier engineering and management institutes, are finding themselves impacted by what market experts are labeling a \"fresher glut”, according to an ET report. This glut results from a surge in the talent pool of young professionals, comprising recent graduates and those with one to two years of experience.Recently, a fresh Vellore Institute of Technology graduate secured a placement with an American e-commerce giant in January, boasting a promised cost-to-company (CTC) package of approximately Rs 50 lakh post-confirmation. The CTC encompassed all perks, benefits, and restricted stock units. However, a few months into the internship, the pre-placement offer was abruptly canceled with the company citing role unavailability, the report quoted S Pasupathi, the chief operating officer at HirePro saying. The recruitment firm is now aiding the graduate in securing alternative employment. This year, the pool has notably expanded due to a higher-than-usual influx of candidates from the 2022 batch of engineers and B-school graduates seeking job changes in sectors like consulting, IT services, and startups. This influx compounds the situation for the 2023 batch of freshers whose final job offers face delays or cancellations.According to data from HirePro, nearly 45% of candidates from the 2022 batch are currently actively seeking employment, compared to the usual 25% in a typical year. The uncertain global macroeconomic climate has compelled companies to trim jobs and tighten recruitment processes to cut costs. S Pasupathi stated, \"Our estimates suggest nearly 20-30% of the offers from the 2023 batch are delayed or revoked.\"This scenario leads to direct competition between the 2022 and 2023 batches, with the looming presence of the 2024 batch entering the job market in a few months. Furthermore, previous batches hold an advantage, having gained on-job experience for a year or so, a factor valued by recruiters, he added.Experts predict that this situation will pose significant challenges for fresher placements in the Class of 2024. Many recruiters seek candidates with a few years of experience who can quickly adapt to their roles, particularly in technology-related sectors and startups, where maintaining a non-billable bench is unsustainable.This predicament unfolds just ahead of the upcoming placement season at business schools and engineering institutes. Tier-1 institutions may experience a milder impact, while tier-2 and tier-3 institutes are likely to be more affected, according to experts.Ciel HR Services CEO Aditya Narayan Mishra noted, \"Our estimates show a decline in hiring of freshers by about 15-20% for the batch which graduated in June-July 2023 compared to a year ago.\" He attributed this decline to companies\\' focus on cost optimization and efficiency improvement. “We see many people who graduated in 2022 and 2023 have not yet found the jobs they aspired for,” he said.Sonal Arora, country manager at GI Group Holding India, observed an abundance of entry-level talent compared to pre-Covid times. She explained, \"It is indeed more than regular years. While 2022 was an exceptional year for fresher/entry level talent with high resurgence in demand, even compared to pre-Covid levels, the supply of talent is more than demand in many sectors like IT services, ITeS, startups, professional services, and consulting, which have been impacted by macroeconomic headwinds.\"',\n",

In contrast, PM Justin Trudeau lags behind with only 31 percent support.According to a Global News report, Ipsos CEO Darrell Bricker noted that the gap between Poilievre and Trudeau in leadership preferences indicates that the Conservatives could secure a majority government if an election were held today. Dissatisfaction with the country\\'s direction, particularly concerning economic concerns, such as the cost of living, access to housing, and inflation, has contributed to this sentiment.Pierre Poilievre\\'s popularity as the Conservative Leader has been steadily increasing, with 40 percent of Canadians now considering him the best choice for Prime Minister. This represents a five-point increase in his favorability ratings compared to the previous year. In contrast, Justin Trudeau\\'s support as the preferred Prime Minister has remained static at 31 percent. Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the NDP (New Democratic Party), who is known for his sympathies towards Khalistan and his coalition partnership with Prime Minister Trudeau, has experienced a four-point decline since September 2022. Currently, only 22 percent of respondents view him as the best choice to lead the government.The poll also delved into core issues affecting Canada, including the economy, healthcare, and housing. It revealed that a plurality of Canadians believe that Pierre Poilievre has the most compelling plans in all three of these areas.Time for Trudeau to step aside?While Justin Trudeau has reiterated his intention to lead the Liberal Party into the upcoming election, a majority of respondents do not view this as a favorable course of action.The Ipsos survey findings indicate that 60 percent of Canadians believe it\\'s time for Trudeau to step down as the leader, allowing someone else to take the reins of the Liberals in the forthcoming election. This marks an increase from the 54 percent recorded in a December 2022 poll.

       " \"There seems to be no stopping for Shah Rukh Khan’s Jawan, as the record breaking spree of the film continues. The movie is all set to break Gadar 2’s box office collection. Gadar 2 till Tuesday, had collected about Rs 520 crore and Jawan stood at Rs 517 crore across languages, as per Sacnilk. The film is expected to collect about Rs 8 crore on Friday which will take it well past Gadar 2’s collection.It had taken Gadar 2 more than three weeks to cross the Rs 500 crore mark but Jawan was able to reach that feat in just about 2 weeks. And it is expected that with the way Jawan is going at the box office, in a few weeks, it can beat Pathaan’s collection to become the highest grossing film for Shah Rukh Khan. He has already become the only actor to deliver two 500 crore hits at the box office in the same year.Though comparing Gadar 2 and Jawan, one needs to understand that Gadar 2 was made at the budget of just Rs 75 crore, whereas the budget for Jawan was about Rs 300 crore as confirmed by Atlee in an interview.Post the success of the movie, Shah Rukh Khan held a press conference and talking about the humongous numbers the film has been collecting he said, “It's a celebration. We rarely get a chance to live with a film for years. The making of Jawan has been going on for four years due to Covid and time constraints. There were a lot of people involved in this film, especially people from the South who came and settled in Mumbai and have been living in Mumbai for the last four years and working day and night for this film, which is the hardest work ever.”The film also starred Nayanthara, Vijay Sethupati, Deepika Padukone and Sanjay Dutt in special appearances.Sanya Malhotra, Priyamani, Girija Oak, Sanjeeta Bhattacharya, Lehar Khan, Aaliyah Qureshi, Ridhi Dogra, Sunil Grover and Mukesh Chhabra formed the strong supporting cast of the film.\",\n",
       " 'In Bollywood, being open about your sexual needs, having intimate relationships, coupled with vices like drinking and smoking (please note that we are calling them vices) has largely been portrayed as a Mumbai/Delhi thing. On the other hand, smaller, Tier II cities (read Lucknow, Nagpur, Jaipur etc) have been relegated to an awkward looking couple exchanging shy glances, secretly meeting at faraway parks, and then turning into quintessential laila majnus when their conservative families catch a whiff of their affair and all hell breaks loose. This is where Maneesh Sharma\\'s Shuddh Desi Romance (2013) broke the mould, shattering the notion that small town millennials (especially girls) can also be open about sexuality and body needs. Though Jaipur, where the movie is set, is a state capital, the Tier II city has hardly ever been explored this way in Bollywood, with filmmakers struggling to go beyond its cliched padharo mhare desh mein narrative. Most importantly, apart from a brilliantly shot Gulabi, some spectacular shots of the Pink City, and mannerisms of a certain Marwari businessman Goyal ji (played fabulously by the late Rishi Kapoor), you can place these characters in any smaller town and the plot would still hold water.Gayatri (Parineeti Chopra), a 20 something young, brash and unfiltered girl, lives solo in Jaipur and apart from studying, poses as a fake wedding guest (employed by Goyal ji) at baraat parties to earn cash on the side. On one such occasion, she hops on a bus, but starts making out with the groom himself, who turns out to be tourist guide Raghu (Sushant Singh Rajput). Lured by their sizzling chemistry, Raghu runs away from the mandap, even as the jilted bride Tara (Vaani Kapoor) seems quite unperturbed by the whole scenario and later, plays a crucial part in the story. Coming back to Gayatri and Raghu, their romance brims faster than instant coffee, as Raghu\\'s quickly moves into Gayatri\\'s modest terrace barsaati and their days are marked by cooking meals, (sometimes) going to work, taking a drag in the balcony and multiple bedroom romps. Of course, it is all fun and games, viewed through rose tinted glasses of young love, till they both think it could be something more. On Diwali night, in a drunken stupor, the two decide to get married, but karma comes to bite Raghu in the a** as this time, the commitment phobic Gayatri runs away from the mandap!A few months later, Raghu bumps into Tara and the two start dating, with all seeming hunky dory, that is, until Gayatri makes a surprise re-entry to his life...Maneesh Sharma, who had earlier helmed movies like Band Baaja Baaraat and Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, seems to have a knack for peeping deep into millennial psyche and how they think and function. Raghu and Gayatri, though good at heart, are indecisive, and mostly live life on the edge. While they mean no harm and are never a hindrance in anyone else\\'s life, they often can become fodder for gossip - just like the guy Raghu bumps into while buying ciggies at the local panwari, who unabashedly shames Gayatri for having a \\'lot of boyfriends\\', without batting an eyelid for Raghu, who too, is part of the relationship. Surprisingly, the good hearted and jovial Goyal ji, remains largely non-judgemental towards the young lovers, but ends up unconsciously slipping personal details about the two to each other, only to nonchalantly declare, \\'dusre ke maamle mein hume kya bolna\\' (why to intervene in someone else\\'s life) in the end. Soon after Gayatri, Raghu finds solace in the arms of Tara, but their relationship, though slightly more stable, is neither serious nor long run. And somewhere, the commitment apart, Raghu\\'s heart still pines for Gayatri and the two decide to give their love another chance.... Live-in relationships, though not for everyone, are more prevalent in today\\'s society than ever. The movie however, does not either berate, nor supports the institution, and Maneesh consciously paints all three leads as deeply flawed, who in no way, should be seen as a benchmark for millenial decisions (we are better than this right?). The movie rather drives home the message that relationships are complicated and what works for one might not work for someone else and that is perfectly okay. As human beings, we all are wired differently and it is okay to not think of marriage as the \\'end goal\\' of any relationship.As Gayatri tells Raghu in the end that marriage is not an option for her for now at least, it is completely fine to not feel ready, now or ever.As the lead stars perfectly sum it up in the title track, \"jhoothe samajo se, jhoothe rivaajo so, liye hi jaaye koi chance\", (let\\'s break away from these hollow rituals and societal pressures) maybe love, the sugar-coated superlatives apart, can best be described as an institution that should be \\'to each its own\\'....You can watch Shuddh Desi Romance on a leading OTT channel...ETimes Decoded is our new, weekly column where we deconstruct movies, characters or plots to uncover a fresh, often undiscovered perspective.',\n",

Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam is not a normal law, this is the proclamation of new democratic commitment of new India.There were many obstacles in the way of this women's reservation bill. But When intentions are pure and there is transparency in attempts, then we witness results overcoming all obstacles. It is a record in itself that this bill got so much support in Parliament. I thank all political parties and MPs for it.Some decisions have the capability to change the country's future and we are witness to one such decision. India has made history on September 20-21. It is our good fortune that people gave us chance to do so. I congratulate all women of the country. Yesterday and the day before, we witnessed the making of a new history. It is our fortune that crores of people gave us the opportunity to create that history.Our govt made every attempt to unshackle women with schemes for their security, respect, prosperity.BJP was making efforts for the last three decades to ensure women's participation in democracy through this law. This was our commitment, and today, we have fulfilled it.This law has proved that a full-majority government, a strong government, a decisive government is a must to take the nation forward.We formed law to stop the ill practice of triple talaq, which caused atrocities on women. Crores of Muslim women have gotten rid of the inhuman practice of triple talaq. When an absolute majority of government came to power in the country, such a huge work could be completed. We did not let anyone's selfishness become a wall before women's reservation. People did vote for the Bill but a few people felt uneasy about why have the words 'Nari Shakti Vandan' been brought. Shouldn't the women of the country be given salutations? Should there be so much arrogance in men and our political ideology that we are unhappy over 'Nari Shakti Vandan'?Earlier on Friday, PM Modi was given a rousing welcome and felicitated by BJP's Mahila Morcha members. The 27-year-long wait for parliamentary clearance for women’s quota in legislatures ended on Thursday as the Rajya Sabha unanimously endorsed the Constitution (128th Amendment) Bill 2023 that seeks to reserve one-third of seats in Lok Sabha and state legislatures.The women's quota bill - Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam - will automatically apply to assemblies of all states and UTs of Delhi and Puducherry.\",\n",

       " \"BATHINDA: Slain gangster-terrorist Sukhdool Singh Gill, aka Sukha Duneke, started out small in 2005, cutting his teeth in crime with petty jobs before graduating to running an extortion racket and carrying out targeted killings from Canada.Thirty-something Sukha, whose roots lie in the nondescript Duneke village of Punjab's Moga district that finds mention in his alias, spent 18 years of his life chasing notoriety before meeting a bloody end in Canada's Winnipeg on Thursday. Known to be a close associate of Arshdeep Singh, alias Arsh Dala, who hails from Dala village in Moga, Sukha was a chip off the old Bambiha gang, originally headed by Davinder Bambiha. Davinder, who was from Bathinda, was killed in an encounter on September 9, 2016, in a paddy field of Gill Kalan village in Bathinda.After Davinder's death, some of his gang members migrated abroad. Sukha, who had seven cases against his name at the time, used his clout to get his application for a second passport verified by police and left for Canada in 2017, sources said.India-Canada News live updatesIn Canada, Sukha came in contact with Arsh, who is believed to have been in touch with slain Khalistan Tiger Force head Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The NIA, in an FIR filed on June 10, 2021, under UAPA, said Arsh and other criminals had been extorting and killing in Punjab at Nijjar's behest.On August 26 last year, Sukha and a few other criminals were charged under UAPA with forming a group to recruit youth in India for criminal acts, including killings. In Canada, Sukha was named in the killing of UK-based kabaddi player Sandeep Nangal Ambian in March 2022. It is only after the murders of Ambian and rapper Sidhu Moose Wala in May that intelligence agencies started looking into records and passports of gangsters residing in foreign countries. Arsh and Sukha were found to be the prime suspects in several instances of crime.Punjab Police's anti-gangster taskforce discovered that Sukha had got a second passport issued with the connivance of some cops posted in Moga despite already having one that had been confiscated. In 2022, two cops were charged with clearing Sukha's passport application by bending rules.Moga SSP J Elenchezhian said the police were trying to get details of how Sukha entered the world of crime and his involvement in criminal activities while in Punjab and later in Canada. His mother and sister lived with him in Canada.Residents of Duneke village are reluctant to talk about Sukha and his family beyond the known facts such as the slain gangster's father being a government employee before he died. Sukha had apparently got a job in the Moga DC's office after his father's death, but he didn't last long there.\",\n",

       " \"Spots up for grabs in World Cup dress rehearsal vs AustraliaOn the face of it, the three-match ODI series between India and Australia, as Pakistan legend Wasim Akram pointed out recently, is pretty much a needless exercise. Squeezed just before the 2023 World Cup, it leaves both the teams with a potential danger of injuring their top players, or at least leaving them jaded. The first ODI at Mohali on Friday will mark the start of Team India's 'Bharat Darshan,' which will involve travelling to as many as 14 cities till November 12 - no mean task even for seasoned backpackers. However, a deeper look at things will tell you that this series does have some value for both the teams. For India, who are just fresh off the Asia Cup triumph, these games offer the best chance to find, hopefully, a final answer to the ' R Ashwin question' in white-ball cricket, which keeps popping up every few years.With left-arm spinner Axar Patel out due to a left quadriceps strain, India have gone back to their old warhorse, off-spinner, who has just turned 37. Having been put on alert since Axar's injury, Ashwin has done all the right things-trained at the NCA, bowled 10 overs in a local league game in Chennai, but nothing can replace the value of this outing - resuming his battle with the likes of Steve Smith and David Warner on featherbeds. Ashwin last played ODIs for India 18 months ago against South Africa in South Africa. Making a comeback in this format after four-and-half years, he wasn't too successful in that series, taking 1-53 in 10 overs 0-68 in 10 overs in the final two games.Previously, he was dropped in 2017 after enduring an ordinary time in the Champions Trophy in England. Still, a few factors make Ashwin's unexpected recall at this hour understandable. His rich experience - 151 wickets in 113 ODIs@33.49, the presence of dangerous left-handers in almost every opposition and the likelihood of wickets which aid spin during India's World Cup matches in the 2023 ODI World Cup - all indicate there may be a place for Ashwin after all.India have also rested their lead spinner Kuldeep Yadav, putting the focus on Ashwin. For starters, the offie would have to stave off competition from Washington Sundar. The other issue is the fitness status of Shreyas Iyer. Picked for the Asia Cup, all the middle order batsman played was two games - in the one against Pakistan, the 28-year-old scored 14, and against Nepal he didn't get to bat. Thereafter, he sat out due to back spasms for four games on a trot, certainly not a good sign for someone returning after a long layoff.With skipper Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli and even allrounder Hardik Pandya resting for the first two games, the likes of Iyer and Suryakumar Yadav, who have endured an ordinary time in the ODIs, will need to assert themselves in this series.Australia will be bolstered by the return of skipper Pat Cummins and Steve Smith from injuries.\",\n",

       " 'DEHRADUN: The central government has given an \\'in-principle\\' approval of a Rs 1,465 crore package to the Uttarakhand government for rehabilitation and reconstruction of subsidence-hit Joshimath town. Confirming the development on Thursday, secretary of the state disaster management department, Ranjit Sinha, told TOI, \"A total amount of Rs 1,800 crore was proposed for the rehabilitation, out of which, we got in-principle approval of Rs 1,465 crore from the central government. The remaining amount of Rs 335 crore will be borne by the state government.\"Sinha said that the money will be disbursed in phases, with the first installment going for rehabilitation of affected families, followed by reconstruction works. All projects will be completed within three years, he added.When asked about the areas which will be permanently banned for settlement in future, Sinha said that \"high-risk zones will be evacuated, keeping in mind the safety of the residents.\" \"Decision in this regard will be taken once we get a final order from the Union government,\" he added. Notably, experts have classified Joshimath town into three categories -- high-risk zone, medium-risk zone, and slight-risk zone. According to sources, almost 1/3rd of the total settlement falls under a high-risk zone.As per Chamoli district administration, the total population of Joshimath ranges from 25,000 to 26,000. Spread over an area of 2.5 sqkm, Joshimath has around 3,900 residential and 400 commercial buildings. Of these buildings, the administration had initially declared 181 buildings as \\'unsafe.\\' Meanwhile, concerned departments are preparing detailed project reports (DPRs) for slope stabilisation, river bank protection, drainage and sewage infrastructure improvement, and retrofitting of unsafe houses, as per senior government officials. The state government, under the rehabilitation policy for Joshimath, has given a one-time settlement to the tune of Rs 33 crore to 150 affected families. Around 296 families were evacuated by the administration and were accommodated in relief camps set up at various places in Joshimath.The problem of subsidence suddenly aggravated in January this year, after a fresh aquifer burst on the night of January 2 with major turbid water flow. This was followed by massive displacement of local people from their houses which either developed cracks or were in unsafe zones.',\n",
       " 'In Bollywood, being open about your sexual needs, having intimate relationships, coupled with vices like drinking and smoking (please note that we are calling them vices) has largely been portrayed as a Mumbai/Delhi thing. On the other hand, smaller, Tier II cities (read Lucknow, Nagpur, Jaipur etc) have been relegated to an awkward looking couple exchanging shy glances, secretly meeting at faraway parks, and then turning into quintessential laila majnus when their conservative families catch a whiff of their affair and all hell breaks loose. This is where Maneesh Sharma\\'s Shuddh Desi Romance (2013) broke the mould, shattering the notion that small town millennials (especially girls) can also be open about sexuality and body needs. Though Jaipur, where the movie is set, is a state capital, the Tier II city has hardly ever been explored this way in Bollywood, with filmmakers struggling to go beyond its cliched padharo mhare desh mein narrative. Most importantly, apart from a brilliantly shot Gulabi, some spectacular shots of the Pink City, and mannerisms of a certain Marwari businessman Goyal ji (played fabulously by the late Rishi Kapoor), you can place these characters in any smaller town and the plot would still hold water.Gayatri (Parineeti Chopra), a 20 something young, brash and unfiltered girl, lives solo in Jaipur and apart from studying, poses as a fake wedding guest (employed by Goyal ji) at baraat parties to earn cash on the side. On one such occasion, she hops on a bus, but starts making out with the groom himself, who turns out to be tourist guide Raghu (Sushant Singh Rajput). Lured by their sizzling chemistry, Raghu runs away from the mandap, even as the jilted bride Tara (Vaani Kapoor) seems quite unperturbed by the whole scenario and later, plays a crucial part in the story. Coming back to Gayatri and Raghu, their romance brims faster than instant coffee, as Raghu\\'s quickly moves into Gayatri\\'s modest terrace barsaati and their days are marked by cooking meals, (sometimes) going to work, taking a drag in the balcony and multiple bedroom romps. Of course, it is all fun and games, viewed through rose tinted glasses of young love, till they both think it could be something more. On Diwali night, in a drunken stupor, the two decide to get married, but karma comes to bite Raghu in the a** as this time, the commitment phobic Gayatri runs away from the mandap!A few months later, Raghu bumps into Tara and the two start dating, with all seeming hunky dory, that is, until Gayatri makes a surprise re-entry to his life...Maneesh Sharma, who had earlier helmed movies like Band Baaja Baaraat and Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, seems to have a knack for peeping deep into millennial psyche and how they think and function. Raghu and Gayatri, though good at heart, are indecisive, and mostly live life on the edge. While they mean no harm and are never a hindrance in anyone else\\'s life, they often can become fodder for gossip - just like the guy Raghu bumps into while buying ciggies at the local panwari, who unabashedly shames Gayatri for having a \\'lot of boyfriends\\', without batting an eyelid for Raghu, who too, is part of the relationship. Surprisingly, the good hearted and jovial Goyal ji, remains largely non-judgemental towards the young lovers, but ends up unconsciously slipping personal details about the two to each other, only to nonchalantly declare, \\'dusre ke maamle mein hume kya bolna\\' (why to intervene in someone else\\'s life) in the end. Soon after Gayatri, Raghu finds solace in the arms of Tara, but their relationship, though slightly more stable, is neither serious nor long run. And somewhere, the commitment apart, Raghu\\'s heart still pines for Gayatri and the two decide to give their love another chance.... Live-in relationships, though not for everyone, are more prevalent in today\\'s society than ever. The movie however, does not either berate, nor supports the institution, and Maneesh consciously paints all three leads as deeply flawed, who in no way, should be seen as a benchmark for millenial decisions (we are better than this right?). The movie rather drives home the message that relationships are complicated and what works for one might not work for someone else and that is perfectly okay. As human beings, we all are wired differently and it is okay to not think of marriage as the \\'end goal\\' of any relationship.As Gayatri tells Raghu in the end that marriage is not an option for her for now at least, it is completely fine to not feel ready, now or ever.As the lead stars perfectly sum it up in the title track, \"jhoothe samajo se, jhoothe rivaajo so, liye hi jaaye koi chance\", (let\\'s break away from these hollow rituals and societal pressures) maybe love, the sugar-coated superlatives apart, can best be described as an institution that should be \\'to each its own\\'....You can watch Shuddh Desi Romance on a leading OTT channel...ETimes Decoded is our new, weekly column where we deconstruct movies, characters or plots to uncover a fresh, often undiscovered perspective.',\n",

       " 'Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas\\' divorce continues to grab headlines as the former couple finds themselves entangled in a custody battle over their two young daughters.The 27-year-old star of \"Game of Thrones\" on Wednesday, sued her 34-year-old estranged husband under the child abduction clauses of the Hague Convention, an international treaty aimed at compelling the return of a child taken from their country of \"habitual residence\", England.Turner, said in her legal documents that she and Jonas made a mutual decision to raise their two daughters in England and to relocate there in April of this year, before their marriage went south. Shortly after filing the legal documents, a cheerie Sophie was spotted spending a day out and about town, running errands with her elder daughter. The actress was accompanied by her team on the causal day out. On spotting the paparazzi, the actress looked visibly upset about the media attention and was seen walking away briskly.Meanwhile, Joe had the full support of his brothers Nick and Kevin. The boys, who were performing at their Jonas Brothers concert, hugged it out on stage after Joe gave an emotional rendition of his hit track \\'Hesitate\\'. In a viral video, Nick was seen walking up to his brother and giving him a tight hug.Later during the gig, the three brothers were also seen hugging it out, making fans a little emotional considering Joe\\'s current divorce drama. The night before news broke about Sophie \\'suing\\' Joe for the custody of the kids, Joe was spotted grabbing beers with Nick at a local pub.Sophie was also spotted out on a dinner date with her girlfriends, including Taylor Swift, who has reportedly lent her full support. The actress was photographed out at a restaurant with her best friend Ellie Johnson, Elvis actress Olivia DeJonge, and Taylor joined in with longtime friend Ashley Avignone.

       " 'HYDERABAD: The craze among car owners for fancy registration numbers has led to RTA coffers brimming this year. Even before the festival season sales kick in, the Telangana State\\'s Road Transport Authority has netted Rs 53.9 crore from the auction of these sought-after numbers in the three districts of Hyderabad, Rangareddy and Medchal. At this rate, officials predict that by the end of this year RTA will comfortably cruise past its 2022 earnings of Rs 72.7 crore from fancy numbers.The much preferred 9999 and a Bond-style 0001, 0007 and 0009 continue to be the hot picks.This year too some of the highest bids so far have been for 9999. While Khairatabad RTO bagged the highest amount with an owner coughing up a staggering Rs 21.6 lakh for it in August, Kondapur RTO saw the same number go for Rs 12.1 lakh. In Malakpet, an individual paid Rs 9.9 lakh to get 9999.Another high-value number that helped Khairatabad RTO earn a fortune was 0009. The top bid amount for this fancy number was ₹10.5 lakh, sealed in August.\"Many consider 9 as a lucky number. Since the sum total of 9999 is also 9, it is a big draw among car owners. This number is mostly preferred by industrialists, construction companies, institutions etc.,\" said a senior RTA official. The RTA made most of its money this year on a single day. \"In August, when 9999 went for ₹21.6 lakh, we saw 0009 go for ₹10.5 lakh and 0001 being taken for ₹3.01 lakh. On that day alone, we had a cumulative earning of ₹53.3 lakh,\" said a senior official of Khairatabad RTO.In fact, officials said that many are now bidding for even random numbers, though their values are much lower than those with a 9. \"We have people bidding for numbers such as 0269, 1223 etc., because it is their parent\\'s or child\\'s birthday. These bids are at times as low as ₹1,000 to ₹2,000 and often has only one person bidding for them. All these smaller bids for two-wheelers and non-luxury cars also add to the revenue,\" added the senior official of Khairatabad RTO.',\n",
       " 'When I met my friend three years after her husband passed away, she insisted that I stay back to hear her stories. She had been married into a traditional family at 18. After 42 years, with her two children having settled into their own homes and lives in another part of the city, she was on her own. She was extremely delighted at her new-found freedom. Senior single women are now living the lives they lost to needless servitude for many years. They did not necessarily suffer in an acrimonious marriage, but had been held hostage to customs, rituals, practices and patriarchy of the earlier times. Many of them did not pursue a career. Even if they did, they gave up promotions and higher responsibility to take care of home. They managed their jobs and homes when they worked, and many did not make independent financial decisions with their money. Now, finally, they have been set free.My friend told me that she now travels with women groups within and outside the country. She had only stepped out to religious places and temples earlier; she is now a tourist and showed me pictures of her curated tour to the Northeast that she took with 12 other women. Limitless fun, she giggled. She dressed better, buying sarees and colours that she liked. Her jewellery and accessories are bolder. She is just one of the many women who have found their feet much later in life, but are determined to make the most of it. Then came the question of finances. My friend told me that she never got involved when her husband was alive, but is now fully in charge. She has been reading, asking questions, learning technology as needed, and taking help from her children. What are the simple rules for single women like her, who want to remain independent for the rest of their lives?First, keep it simple. There is no need to manage multiple bank accounts, mutual funds, brokerage accounts, properties and assets. Consolidate the assets in a manner that makes it easy to monitor and manage efficiently. Two bank accounts, one for the family pension and another for everything else, will do. All other investments should not exceed 10-12 products. There is no need to own stocks or trade unless one is interested in such activity. A few actively managed diversified mutual funds and a couple of ETFs will do the job with respect to equity investing. Some bank deposits are adequate for income and yield. A balanced fund is a better route to managing both equity and debt in a single product. Second, learn operational, procedural and tax-related aspects. I have seen many women learn processes very efficiently, even if they are put off by product brochures and return-risk matrices. Learn to keep passwords and change them; master the operational aspects of cashless payment, cards and credit. Take the time to understand income-tax returns even while engaging a professional to file the returns for you. Learn about phishing, scams and online security, which is simple and common sensical. Be a hands-on manager for your money since it is not tough to operate if you don’t have a complex portfolio.Third, do not be tempted to change, revise, and rework your investment strategy too often. This may be superfluous. If you hold a few long-term products with simple and specific features, you will do fine without modifications. Review once a year to see if something is not working well. Discuss with your advisers and friends, and read yourself before making changes. There is no need to jump into the latest bandwagon. Just ensure your current train is moving steadily as desired.Fourth, learn about the options for using your money, and optimise these. Understand how a systematic withdrawal plan works. Learn that idle, unutilised money in the bank is wasted. Have a short-term bank deposit to bunch up savings for a few months and use it as needed. Understand how your regular income, investment income, and principal drawals are being spent. Even if you don’t keep account, learn to review bank statements and credit card statements to check which are the major heads of expenses. Keep control and be informed.Fifth, learn to keep money matters private. Your financial adviser and accountant are bound by contract to keep your information private. You need not discuss the actual numbers, flows or stocks with others. Be discreet and learn that power comes from keeping money decisions close to your chest.If you gift a nephew ₹10,000 at his wedding, it will be seen as a generous gift. Not if they knew that your assets are worth ₹10 crore. Others don’t have to feel entitled to your wealth, however small or large it might be. Sixth, adopt minimalistic lifestyle to make it easier for your children after you pass. At this stage of life, you care more for experiences than things. Keep the material things minimal, and give away and reduce what you have. I recall the painful task of evaluating and selling a locker full of jewels that children of another friend had to endure. If you must keep them, take the time to tabulate their cost, year of purchase, weight and such information. If it is tough for you to do this, imagine the plight of your children after you are gone.Seventh, focus on your health and develop healthy habits to keep fit. Inform your children about your desire with respect to invasive health care, terminal illness and caregiving. Allocate funds for default medical check-ups and follow-ups. Be willing to spend on supportive help. Ensure a good network of friends and relationships to keep you cheerful, and reach out to when in need. It is lovely to be independent and able to reclaim the joys of one’s life. Align the finances and exercise the same enthusiasm to keep control and be in charge.The author is chairperson, centre for investment education and learning',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: Union sports minister Anurag Thakur has cancelled his visit to China for the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou after Chinese authorities denied accreditation and entry to three sportspersons from Arunachal Pradesh for the games, which begin on September 23.Visas were refused by athletes: OCA ethics panel chiefWei Jizhong, chairman of the ethics panel of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) -- the sports governing body for the Asian Games -- said that the Indian athletes have been granted a visa to enter China and that Beijing has not refused any visa.\"These Indian athletes have got the visa already to enter China. China didn\\'t refuse any visa. Unfortunately, these athletes didn\\'t accept this visa. I don\\'t think this is OCA problem because China has an agreement to let all the athletes who have certified eligibility come to compete in China. This is clear. The visa has already been granted,\" said Wei.The OCA\\'s acting president Randhir Singh said: \"We had a meeting on Thursday with the Working Group and this has been taken up. They are taking it up with the government and we are also taking it up with the government.\"Discrimination based on domicile: MEAThe development comes as the Ministry of External Affairs reacted to reports of discrimination by Chinese authorities.\"The government of India has learnt that the Chinese authorities have, in a targeted and pre-meditated manner, discriminated against some Indian sportspersons from the state of Arunachal Pradesh by denying them accreditation and entry to the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, China,\" said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.\"In line with our long-standing and consistent position, India firmly rejects differential treatment of Indian citizens based on domicile or ethnicity. Arunachal Pradesh was, is and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India. A strong protest has been lodged in New Delhi and Beijing against China\\'s deliberate and selective obstruction of some of our sportspersons,\" he added. The MEA said that China’s action violates both the spirit of the Asian Games and the rules governing their conduct, which explicitly prohibits discrimination against competitors from member states. \"As a mark of our protest against the Chinese action, the Union sports minister has cancelled his scheduled visit to China for the Games. The government of India reserves the right to take suitable measures to safeguard our interests,\" added Bagchi.Martial arts athletesSeveral media reports stated that three Indian martial arts athletes from Arunachal Pradesh have been forced to pull out of the Asian Games after not receiving clearance from the host country.The three women are wushu fighters. Wushu, or kung fu, is a multi-disciplinary martial art originating in China. The trio was approved to take part by the Hangzhou Asian Games Organising Committee but were unable to download their accreditation cards -- which act as visas to enter China. The rest of the 10-member squad along with the coaching staff left for the Games in Hangzhou on Wednesday. Past incidentThe Indian wushu team did not travel to the Chinese city of Chengdu for the World University Games in July this year after the same three athletes were issued stapled, rather than pasted, visas -- an indication that Beijing does not recognise India\\'s territorial claim over Arunachal Pradesh, said some media reports.The move triggered angry reactions from the Indian side with the foreign ministry saying it was \"unacceptable\".(With inputs from agencies)',\n",

According to the reports, the incident happened at a house party organised at the flat where several students were present. Police have also recovered liquor bottles from the house but have refuted claims of any party being held at the flat.\"It was a rented flat where Aditya, a resident of Ballia, used to live and had called Nishtha to meet.

Even before the festival season sales kick in, the Telangana State\\'s Road Transport Authority has netted Rs 53.9 crore from the auction of these sought-after numbers in the three districts of Hyderabad, Rangareddy and Medchal. At this rate, officials predict that by the end of this year RTA will comfortably cruise past its 2022 earnings of Rs 72.7 crore from fancy numbers.The much preferred 9999 and a Bond-style 0001, 0007 and 0009 continue to be the hot picks.This year too some of the highest bids so far have been for 9999. While Khairatabad RTO bagged the highest amount with an owner coughing up a staggering Rs 21.6 lakh for it in August, Kondapur RTO saw the same number go for Rs 12.1 lakh. In Malakpet, an individual paid Rs 9.9 lakh to get 9999.Another high-value number that helped Khairatabad RTO earn a fortune was 0009. The top bid amount for this fancy number was ₹10.5 lakh, sealed in August.\"Many consider 9 as a lucky number. Since the sum total of 9999 is also 9, it is a big draw among car owners. This number is mostly preferred by industrialists, construction companies, institutions etc.,\" said a senior RTA official. The RTA made most of its money this year on a single day. \"In August, when 9999 went for ₹21.6 lakh, we saw 0009 go for ₹10.5 lakh and 0001 being taken for ₹3.01 lakh.

These bids are at times as low as ₹1,000 to ₹2,000 and often has only one person bidding for them.

       " 'JPMorgan has made a significant decision to include India in the Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) index after nearly two years of monitoring. This move is highly anticipated and is expected to have several positive impacts. India\\'s inclusion in this prominent and widely-followed bond index will lower its borrowing costs and attract passive investments of approximately $30 billion into the domestic debt market, according to an ET report. This development is also likely to stabilize the Indian rupee, reduce interest rates, lower bond yields, and subsequently reduce the cost of borrowing which will be a boost for the bottomline of companies.Mukesh Kochar, National Head - Wealth at AUM Capital, highlighted, \"This will reset the base rate for India and the yield should come down sharply. India\\'s cost of borrowing will come down. Since Covid, the fiscal deficit in India has remained elevated due to higher borrowing. This event will ease borrowing pressure as a large part of the borrowing will be observed by this route. Banks\\' Treasury will be flushed with mark-to-market gains.\"Additionally, the Indian rupee is poised to benefit from a significant inflow of dollars resulting from the purchase of government securities.In terms of the equity market, this development is seen as positive for banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), and leveraged companies. Mukesh Kochar stated, \"By and large it is a big macro positive for India.\" India will enter the global bond index with a 10% weight cap and other smaller JPM EM indices gradually over a 10-month period starting from June 28, 2024. Market experts estimate that this move could trigger passive inflows of approximately $30 billion.Emkay Global\\'s lead economist, Madhavi Arora, emphasized that this inclusion will structurally reduce India\\'s risk premia and cost of funding, enhance the liquidity and ownership base of government securities, and assist India in financing its fiscal and current account deficits.Most corporate bond yields are tied to government bond yields, so the decline in yields will have a widespread impact across industries. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, explained, \"Therefore, yields will decline pan India, across industries. The decline in the cost of capital will translate into higher profits for the corporate sector, which, in turn, will boost stock prices enabling the stock market to scale higher levels.\"The passive inflows resulting from India\\'s inclusion are expected to elevate India\\'s international standing and further strengthen its local fundamentals. Axis Mutual Fund anticipates that this move will prompt the RBI to conduct sterilization operations, fortifying forex reserves and the currency. It may also open doors for long-term debt capital to support India\\'s extensive infrastructure and development requirements.India\\'s bond market, currently the third largest among emerging markets (EMs) after China, boasts a market capitalization of over $1.2 trillion, nearly triple that of Indonesia\\'s and comparable to Brazil\\'s. However, foreign portfolio investment (FPI) ownership of India Government Securities (G-Secs) is less than 2%, significantly lower than EM peers.With Russia\\'s exclusion and issues in China, global debt investors\\' options have become more limited, analysts have noted.Banking industry veteran Keki Mistry believes that India’s inclusion will also help enhance its forex reserves. “Our forex reserves were at one time nearly $600 billion and they came down to about $550 billion odd a few months ago. But in the last six months or so, we recouped all those losses and we have come back to a reserve position close to $600 billion. So this would only further improve that,” he said.However, JPMorgan\\'s inclusion of India in the bond index does not immediately guarantee inclusion in FTSE and Bloomberg indexes, as these have stricter conditions related to FPI taxation and Euroclear requirements. Madhavi Arora pointed out, \"Changes to laws for taxing FPI capital gains, which would have helped India adhere to Euroclear requirements, were not a major impediment for India’s inclusion in the JPM index. However, this is still a major stumbling block for the Bloomberg indices, though not so much for the FTSE indices.\"Recent progress in addressing operational issues, such as margin requirements and extended settlement times, has played a crucial role in India securing inclusion in the JPM GBI-EM index. The removal of Russia from the index has also contributed to making the index slightly more concentrated, with India\\'s inclusion helping to diversify holdings, the economist added.',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: Union sports minister Anurag Thakur has cancelled his visit to China for the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou after Chinese authorities denied accreditation and entry to three sportspersons from Arunachal Pradesh for the games, which begin on September 23.Visas were refused by athletes: OCA ethics panel chiefWei Jizhong, chairman of the ethics panel of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) -- the sports governing body for the Asian Games -- said that the Indian athletes have been granted a visa to enter China and that Beijing has not refused any visa.\"These Indian athletes have got the visa already to enter China. China didn\\'t refuse any visa. Unfortunately, these athletes didn\\'t accept this visa. I don\\'t think this is OCA problem because China has an agreement to let all the athletes who have certified eligibility come to compete in China. This is clear. The visa has already been granted,\" said Wei.The OCA\\'s acting president Randhir Singh said: \"We had a meeting on Thursday with the Working Group and this has been taken up. They are taking it up with the government and we are also taking it up with the government.\"Discrimination based on domicile: MEAThe development comes as the Ministry of External Affairs reacted to reports of discrimination by Chinese authorities.\"The government of India has learnt that the Chinese authorities have, in a targeted and pre-meditated manner, discriminated against some Indian sportspersons from the state of Arunachal Pradesh by denying them accreditation and entry to the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, China,\" said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.\"In line with our long-standing and consistent position, India firmly rejects differential treatment of Indian citizens based on domicile or ethnicity. Arunachal Pradesh was, is and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India. A strong protest has been lodged in New Delhi and Beijing against China\\'s deliberate and selective obstruction of some of our sportspersons,\" he added. The MEA said that China’s action violates both the spirit of the Asian Games and the rules governing their conduct, which explicitly prohibits discrimination against competitors from member states. \"As a mark of our protest against the Chinese action, the Union sports minister has cancelled his scheduled visit to China for the Games. The government of India reserves the right to take suitable measures to safeguard our interests,\" added Bagchi.Martial arts athletesSeveral media reports stated that three Indian martial arts athletes from Arunachal Pradesh have been forced to pull out of the Asian Games after not receiving clearance from the host country.The three women are wushu fighters. Wushu, or kung fu, is a multi-disciplinary martial art originating in China. The trio was approved to take part by the Hangzhou Asian Games Organising Committee but were unable to download their accreditation cards -- which act as visas to enter China. The rest of the 10-member squad along with the coaching staff left for the Games in Hangzhou on Wednesday. Past incidentThe Indian wushu team did not travel to the Chinese city of Chengdu for the World University Games in July this year after the same three athletes were issued stapled, rather than pasted, visas -- an indication that Beijing does not recognise India\\'s territorial claim over Arunachal Pradesh, said some media reports.The move triggered angry reactions from the Indian side with the foreign ministry saying it was \"unacceptable\".(With inputs from agencies)',\n",
       " 'Chinese TV brands in India are experiencing a decline in market share, marking a similar trend seen in the smartphone sector, according to an ET report. Key reasons include strategic adjustments by established players like LG and Samsung, who have lowered entry-level model prices while capitalizing on premium offerings since the onset of the pandemic. Simultaneously, Chinese brands have scaled back their focus on low-margin product categories to curb cash burn.Industry executives quoted by ET suggest that Chinese companies like OnePlus and Realme may either exit or significantly downsize their presence in the Indian television market. Despite attempts to seek comments by the financial daily, OnePlus and Realme did not respond to inquiries by the time of press.According to recent data from Counterpoint Technology, Chinese brands\\' share of TV shipments dropped from 35.7% in the April-June quarter of the previous year to 33.6% during the same period this year. Executives quoted above anticipate further declines in July and August, with Chinese brands\\' market share potentially dipping further.The decline in Chinese brands\\' shipments can be attributed to consumer preferences shifting towards mid-range and premium models from players like Samsung, LG, and Sony. Anshika Jain, a senior analyst at Counterpoint, commented, \"The reason for the decline in the shipments of Chinese brands is due to the consumer preference for the mid-segment and premium models from Samsung, LG, and Sony, and also growing interest towards other brands like Sansui and Acer as we have seen frequent upgrades happening in the market, expanding the choices for the customers.\"Pulkit Baid, director of Great Eastern Retail, noted that the television market is undergoing consolidation and correction. He stated, \"While brands like Llyod are getting aggressive, the Chinese brands, which had earlier penetrated significantly, are now wrapping up their losses.\"In the smartphone sector, Chinese brands have been steadily losing market share for four consecutive quarters. They are moving away from the entry-level segment, priced below Rs 7,000-8,000, where they once dominated, and are now focusing on competing with Samsung, Apple, and others in the mid-to-premium range to enhance profitability.Chinese brands remain dominant in the smartphone market, but in the TV segment, they face fewer competitors, creating opportunities for other brands to gain traction.From 2017-18, Chinese brands such as Xiaomi, OnePlus, Realme, TCL, and iFfalcon disrupted the Indian TV market by offering models at significantly lower prices, challenging established players like LG, Samsung, and Sony. This fierce price competition led to the exit or reduced emphasis of major brands on entry-level models.Avneet Singh Marwah, CEO of SPPL, which holds licenses to sell Kodak, Thomson, and Blaupunkt television brands in India, explained, \"The strategy of the Chinese TV brands was to cut prices to gain quick market share. This increased their losses. Plus, television panel prices have become so volatile that it is very difficult to generate profit without dedicated focus.\" Marwah added that Chinese brands are now turning their attention to their primary product—smartphones, presenting an opportunity for other brands like the ones he sells to gain market share.',\n",
       " \"BHOPAL: The central bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has issued a stern directive to the Madhya Pradesh government directing immediate and comprehensive action to control and mitigate the pollution of the Narmada river and respond within a month. The NGT's intervention comes in response to a concerning petition highlighting the grave issue of sewage discharge plaguing the Narmada river, a lifeline that traverses through 14 cities and towns along its 1077-km course within the state. The petition asserts that untreated sewage from approximately 2.2 million residents of Madhya Pradesh is being indiscriminately released into the Narmada's waters, upon which millions of people in Gujarat and Rajasthan depend. Statistics reveal that the collective sewage generation from these 14 urban areas amounts to nearly 200 million Liters per Day (MLD). Shockingly, only around 87 MLD of sewage have access to treatment facilities, leaving a glaring gap in sewage management. To bridge this gap, roughly 60 MLD is currently being treated through in-situ bioremediation methods, as Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) are still under construction. Most concerning is the fact that an alarming 51 MLD of untreated sewage is being directly discharged into the Narmada river, posing a threat to its water quality and overall ecosystem.NGT has taken a decisive action to address this dire situation. The tribunal has instructed the secretary of environment and the member secretary of the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) to gather essential data from all district nagistrates of cities and towns located along the Narmada river's banks, spanning from Amarkantak to Dhar. This critical data must be submitted to the tribunal within an uncompromising 30-day deadline.Subsequently, member secretary of the MPPCB CP Thakur has issued notices to collectors in Bhopal, Indore, Ujjain, Dindori, Mandla, Anuppur, Narsinghpur, Jabalpur, Harda, Dewas, Raisen, Sehore, Khandwa, Khargone, Dhar and Barwani districts to enforce the NGT's orders.Additionally, the NGT's directive extends to the collectors of these districts and cities along the Narmada's banks. They have been explicitly instructed to take immediate measures to prevent any encroachments on the river bodies or its banks. Legal actions must be initiated against any encroachment and ongoing efforts to protect floodplain zones from encroachment should be closely supervised by designated officials.The NGT has underscored the critical need to revitalize non-operational sewage treatment plants (STPs) and expedite the upgrade of existing STPs to employ advanced technologies such as sequential batch reactor (SBR). Furthermore, the NGT has stressed the urgency of addressing gaps in sewage and effluent generation and treatment across the state. This includes establishing functional sewage treatment plants (STPs), common effluent treatment plants (CEPTs) and effluent treatment plants (ETPs).To tackle pollution at its source, the NGT has ordered punitive measures against polluting industries, issuing show-cause notices to defaulters. Environmental compensation (EC) imposed on violators should be meticulously calculated based on parameters established by the tribunal and the State Pollution Control Board. Non-compliance will result in necessary legal prosecution alongside environmental compensation.The NGT has mandated that the secretary of environment oversee and report on the actions taken on a weekly basis, with a comprehensive report due within 30 days. Copies of the NGT's orders will be forwarded to relevant authorities, including the principal secretary of the urban administration and development department, the principal secretary of environment, the member secretary of the State Pollution Control Board and all 14 district magistrates along the Narmada river.These directives from the NGT come in response to persistent and severe pollution in the Narmada river, as highlighted in a writ petition filed in the high courts of Gujarat and Rajasthan. The petition emphasized the release of untreated sewage in large quantities by local authorities in Madhya Pradesh, causing extensive harm to the river's ecosystem.The Narmada river holds immense ecological and socio-economic importance, serving as a lifeline for millions of people in Gujarat and Rajasthan. It supports agriculture in drought-prone regions and provides drinking water to numerous communities. Substantial investments have been made in the river's rejuvenation through the construction of the Sardar Sarovar dam and an extensive canal network.Approximately 2.2 million people in Madhya Pradesh release sewage into the Narmada without proper treatment, posing significant health risks to downstream users, say officials. The contamination of the river with sewage has been linked to drug-resistant bacteria, causing serious health issues. The pollution of the river has also resulted in diseases such as cholera, hepatitis, dysentery, and skin conditions.The NGT's actions follow years of unregulated construction and illegal encroachments along the riverbanks, as well as the significant dumping of industrial waste and civic sewage. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has identified several cities discharging untreated wastewater into the Narmada, along with the detrimental use of chemical fertilizers in the river's vicinity.Despite efforts over the last four years, progress in addressing the pollution of the Narmada river has been limited. The NGT has called upon all concerned parties to adhere to its orders and take immediate action to protect the Narmada river from further pollution, ensuring its continued vitality and ecological significance.Narmada river, often referred to as the lifeline of western India, plays an important role in quenching the thirst of millions across Gujarat, including the water-scarce regions of Saurashtra and Kutch. Additionally, it breathes life into arid areas like Jalore and Barmer in Rajasthan. This remarkable waterway irrigates millions of hectares of agricultural land in drought-prone regions, facilitated by an extensive canal network that spans thousands of kilometres.The government's substantial investments in the Sardar Sarovar dam on the Narmada and the expansive canal network have reached astronomical figures, currently totaling Rs 43,771.26 crore. Moreover, ongoing investments are being made to expand this critical canal infrastructure.Presently, the effluent of approximately 2.2 million residents of Madhya Pradesh is released untreated into the Narmada's waters, which millions of people in Gujarat and Rajasthan rely upon.Remarkably, a staggering 80% of the Narmada river's journey unfolds within Madhya Pradesh, where numerous cities and towns discharge untreated sewage directly into its waters, lacking functional Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs). The preservation of this invaluable lifeline demands immediate attention and concerted efforts to mitigate the adverse impacts of pollution, officials say.\",\n",

The high court observed that the investigation is on fulcrum of attaining finality and it is not inclined to interfere with the impugned proceedings at this stage.Naidu's counsels contended that the registration of FIR was not done in accordance with the procedure contemplated in section 17A of Prevention of Corruption Act (PC Act). On the other hand, the CID counsels argued that the petition should not be entertained as the protection under 17A is not an absolute bar on registration of crime. They have also argued that the power under section 482 of CrPC should be exercised sparingly in rare and exceptional cases only.Dealing with legal aspects in the arguments on both sides, Justice K Srinivasa Reddy observed that the Supreme Court laid down parameters for exercise of jurisdiction under section 482 CrPC and none of the parameters laid down by the apex court for interference by this court at this stage has been made out.Justice Srinivasa Reddy further noted that the high court is of the opinion that irrespective of the disputed questions of fact, a mini trial cannot be conducted by this court in a petition filed under section 482 CrPC. The investigating agency, pursuant to the registration of the crime in the year 2021, examined as many as more than 140 witnesses and collected documents to the tune of more than 4000, he said adding that profligacy is such an esoteric subject, where investigation has to be carried with utmost proficiency by the professionals and hence the consequential reliefs sought are dismissed, said the high court.Court grants CID 2-day custodyA court on Friday granted two days custody of Naidu to CID for further interrogation in connection with the Skill Development Corporation scam.

       " 'Korean women have long been heralded as pioneers in the world obsessed with skincare, celebrated for their unwavering commitment to achieving and maintaining youthful, luminous complexions. Central to their regimen is the ingenious incorporation of face masks, heralded as the secret weapon in their quest for ageless beauty.Korean women are known for their dedication to skincare, and they have popularized various skincare routines and products around the world. One of the key components of Korean skincare routines is the use of face masks.One popular type of face mask in Korean skincare is the sheet mask. Sheet masks are single-use masks that are typically made of a thin, cotton-like material soaked in a serum or essence. They come in various formulations targeting different skin concerns, such as hydration, brightening, firming, and anti-aging.While there isn\\'t a specific \"magic\" mask that guarantees eternal youth, many Korean sheet masks are formulated with ingredients like hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, vitamin C, and various botanical extracts, which are known for their hydrating, brightening, and anti-aging properties.Korean women often incorporate sheet masks into their skincare routines, using them regularly, sometimes even daily or a few times a week, as a way to provide an extra boost of nutrients and hydration to their skin. Why these sheet masks are so good?The sheet mask, is a marvel of innovation and simplicity. Comprising a delicate, serum-soaked fabric, these masks are saturated with potent formulations designed to infuse the skin with a symphony of revitalizing ingredients. The meticulous curation of these elixirs includes stalwarts like hyaluronic acid, a moisture-retaining powerhouse, and vitamin-rich botanical extracts known for their rejuvenating prowess.Korean women embrace these masks as a ritualistic practice, weaving them seamlessly into their daily skincare routine. It is not uncommon for these women to indulge in the restorative embrace of a face mask several times a week, or even daily, demonstrating a commitment to preserving youthful vitality that verges on the reverent.A cornerstone of the Korean approach to skincare is the conviction that prevention is as paramount as correction. Thus, these masks serve not only as a means to reverse the signs of aging but also as a proactive measure against their onset. Through regular application, the skin is fortified against the onslaught of environmental stressors, fortifying its resilience and perpetuating its youthful glow. The efficacy of these masks lies not only in their scientifically formulated serums but also in the method of delivery. By cocooning the face in a protective veil, the mask creates an occlusive environment, allowing the active ingredients to penetrate deeply and more effectively. This symbiosis between formulation and application is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship ingrained in Korean skincare.Moreover, the ritual of applying a face mask transcends the physical. It is an act of self-care, an opportunity for introspection, and a moment of reprieve from the demands of daily life. This holistic approach to skincare underscores the interconnectedness of inner well-being and outer radiance.',\n",

       " 'Vivek Ramaswamy, the Indian-American Republican presidential candidate, has delivered a significant foreign policy address in his home state of Ohio, outlining his vision for achieving economic independence from China. He proposed a series of measures aimed at realizing this goal, along with fostering stronger ties with countries like India.Several Republican primary contenders have shown a willingness to confront China\\'s aggressive actions through tariffs, with former President Donald Trump being the most prominent advocate of this approach. However, many have expressed reluctance to disrupt existing trade relationships with Beijing. But Ramaswamy asserted that there\\'s no time for terms like \"de-risking\" or \"diversifying.\" Instead, Ramaswamy is set to introduce a resolute \"pro-trade strategy for sensibly decoupling from China.\"Speaking to a gathering at a plastics manufacturing facility in New Albany, Ohio, Ramaswamy emphasized that our primary adversary today is not the USSR, which dissolved in 1990, but rather Communist China.The biotech entrepreneur contends that his trade-centric approach represents the only \"substantive\" effort among GOP candidates. He aims to modernize the Reagan Doctrine by shifting its focus from \"peace through strength\" to \"prosperity through peace.\"Ramaswamy emphasized the imperative of reducing reliance on Chinese-controlled pharmaceutical supply chains and increasing military spending as part of his strategy. He stressed that his approach offers a practical and clear path to declare economic independence from China while concurrently advancing domestic prosperity.The 38-year-old entrepreneur, whose popularity has been on the rise following his impressive performance in the first Republican presidential primary debate last month, elaborated on following key elements of his policy:Declaring Independence from the Climate Change Agenda: Ramaswamy criticized the climate change agenda as a \"farce\" and a \"hoax\" and pledged to declare independence from it.Increased Military Spending: Ramaswamy called for heightened military spending to enhance homeland defense capabilities.Moving Away from Chinese-controlled Pharmaceutical Supply Chains: Expressing concerns about potential contamination, he advocated distancing the United States from pharmaceutical supply chains controlled by China, especially regarding legal pharmaceuticals.Economic Independence from Taiwan: He proposed boosting the production of US semiconductors, the essential components powering phones, satellite systems, medical devices, and communication devices, to achieve economic independence from Taiwan.Ramaswamy pointed out the Chinese Communist Party\\'s tactics of building barriers for market entry when criticizing China and rolling out the red carpet for those who criticize the United States. He cited examples, including BlackRock\\'s CEO Larry Fink\\'s lobbying efforts, to illustrate this dynamic.\"Take BlackRock, the first asset manager ever to be granted the right to sell mutual funds as a foreign asset manager in China. How did they get it? It was only after BlackRock\\'s CEO Larry Fink lobbied in the United States for lowered listing standards for Chinese companies in the US,\" he claimed.He emphasized that, if elected as President in November 2024, he would focus on achieving economic independence from China and highlighted the president\\'s unique role in shaping foreign policy.Ramaswamy stressed his commitment to avoiding World War III, revitalizing national pride, and dismantling regulatory obstacles under the executive branch, without having to rely on Congress for approval or forgiveness. He cautioned against making legislative promises contingent on Congress, referencing former President Donald Trump\\'s unfulfilled pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare as an example of such challenges.(With inputs from agencies)',\n",

       " \"NOIDA: To ease traffic congestion in bustling Bengaluru, the Karnataka government has been advised to impose a congestion tax on vehicles entering the city through high-density roads during peak hours.What is congestion tax?Congestion tax is a system of charging vehicles to enter certain areas of a city during peak hours. It is a popular tool to reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. It can also help to strengthen public transportation by encouraging people to switch from private vehicles.Is congestion tax a good idea for Bengaluru?Experts say congestion tax is a good idea for Bengaluru. The city is struggling with severe traffic congestion, and a congestion tax could help to reduce the number of private vehicles on the road. This would make it faster and easier for everyone to get around, and it would also improve air quality.How congestion tax will help Bengaluru?BMTC officials believe that a congestion tax in high-density corridors would discourage private vehicles and encourage public transport, as it would make driving more expensive and public transport more attractive.How Bengaluru is planning to collect congestion tax?FASTag, which has been successfully implemented here since 2021, could be used to collect congestion tax for ease and convenience. Toll machines would be placed at major access points to busy areas, and vehicles would be photographed with cameras as they cross the toll points. The congestion tax would then be automatically deducted from the vehicle owner's bank account.Has congestion tax system been implemented in any other Indian city?No. Similar proposals for congestion taxes in New Delhi and Mumbai failed in the past, largely due to political opposition and lobbying from the private car industry.What are the high-density corridors in Bengaluru?The high-density corridors in the city include Outer Ring Road, Sarjapur Road, Hosur Road, Old Airport Road, Old Madras Road, Ballari Road, Bannerghatta Road, Kanakapura Road, Magadi Road, West of Chord Road and Tumakuru Road.Which major world cities have congestion tax system?Singapore, London, and Stockholm are all examples of cities that have successfully implemented congestion pricing.Singapore: Singapore's congestion pricing system is fully automated and uses variable charges depending on the time of day and the specific area of the city.London: In London, vehicles entering central London during business hours on weekdays have to pay a charge.Stockholm: In Stockholm, there is a tax on vehicles entering the city on weekdays during the day.\",\n",
       " \"Sunny Deol starrer 'Gadar 2' is now in its sixth week and the film has roared at the box office and how! By the end of its week 6, the film has emerged as the highest nett grosser of all times. Though, it is expected that 'Jawan' will break that record in the coming weeks. However, despite the fact that 'Gadar 2' faced competition from 'Jawan', it has managed to have the highest nett collections by the end of this week. As per boxofficeindia.com, 'Gadar 2' has made Rs 513 crore nett and beaten the numbers of 'Baahubali - The Conclusion' and 'Pathaan'. Just the week 6 collection of the movie is around 2.75 crore. Shah Rukh Khan starrer 'Jawan' will beat its collections but yet, 'Gadar 2' will be the biggest hit of the year and it is likely to remain so till the end of the year, unless a big surprise springs in. As far as individual circuits are concerned, it has set record in areas like Delhi, UP, East Punjab, Rajasthan and Bihar. But due to the release of 'Jawan', the numbers of 'Gadar 2' have fallen short in comparison to 'Baahubali', as the collections went down post September 7. Meanwhile, 'Jawan' had an extra-ordinary second week as it made around Rs 120 crore and the total collection so far, now stands at Rs 460 crore. The film directed by Atlee continues to have a steady hold at the box office and that is expected in the coming weeks as well.\",\n",
       " \"NEW DELHI: Characterizing Canada as a sanctuary for terrorists, a label previously applied only to Pakistan, the Indian government took a significant step on Thursday by suspending visa processing services in the North American nation. This move came in response to threats from Khalistan forces, which hindered the ability of Indian diplomats to carry out their duties.Against the backdrop of a heated diplomatic dispute triggered by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations that India might have been linked to the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a pro-Khalistan activist and Canadian national, India also made the decision to suspend the e-visa facility for Canadian citizens.Here is an FAQs on India's visa suspension for Canadians:Why did India suspend visa services for Canadians?A: India suspended visa services for Canadians on September 21, 2023, citing security threats to its diplomatic missions in Canada. The move came after Canada accused India of allegedly being involved in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was shot dead in Surrey, B.C., on June 18, 2023. India has denied the allegation and expelled a Canadian diplomat in retaliation.Q: Who is affected by the suspension of visa services?A: All Canadian nationals who intend to visit India and do not have a valid visa are affected by the suspension of visa services. This includes tourists, students, business travellers, and others. The suspension also applies to Canadians in a third country who want to apply for an Indian visa.Q: What are the exemptions from the suspension of visa services?A: The suspension of visa services does not affect those who already have a valid Indian visa or an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card. OCI card holders are people of Indian origin who have acquired foreign citizenship. They can enter and stay in India indefinitely without a visa.Q: How long will the suspension of visa services last?A: There is no official announcement on how long the suspension of visa services will last. It depends on how the diplomatic row between India and Canada is resolved. Both countries have expressed their desire to maintain good relations and cooperate on various issues, such as trade, security, and climate change.Q: What are the alternatives for Canadians who want to visit India?A: Canadians who want to visit India and do not have a valid visa or an OCI card have limited options. They can try to apply for an emergency visa at the Indian High Commission in Ottawa or the Consulates General in Toronto and Vancouver. However, these visas are only granted for urgent and compelling reasons, such as death or serious illness of a family member in India. Another option is to wait until the suspension of visa services is lifted or travel to another country that does not require a visa for Canadians.Q: Can Indians with valid visas travel to Canada?A: Yes, Indians with valid visas can travel to Canada. There are no restrictions on Indian travelers to Canada or on those with valid Indian visas. However, India has issued a travel advisory asking Indian nationals, including students and citizens planning on traveling to Canada, to exercise caution. They have been advised to avoid travelling to regions and potential venues in Canada that have seen growing anti-India activities, such as protests by Sikh separatists.Q: Has Canada suspended processing of visas for Indians?A: No, Canada has not suspended processing of visas for Indians.\",\n",

       " 'Chinese TV brands in India are experiencing a decline in market share, marking a similar trend seen in the smartphone sector, according to an ET report. Key reasons include strategic adjustments by established players like LG and Samsung, who have lowered entry-level model prices while capitalizing on premium offerings since the onset of the pandemic. Simultaneously, Chinese brands have scaled back their focus on low-margin product categories to curb cash burn.Industry executives quoted by ET suggest that Chinese companies like OnePlus and Realme may either exit or significantly downsize their presence in the Indian television market. Despite attempts to seek comments by the financial daily, OnePlus and Realme did not respond to inquiries by the time of press.According to recent data from Counterpoint Technology, Chinese brands\\' share of TV shipments dropped from 35.7% in the April-June quarter of the previous year to 33.6% during the same period this year. Executives quoted above anticipate further declines in July and August, with Chinese brands\\' market share potentially dipping further.The decline in Chinese brands\\' shipments can be attributed to consumer preferences shifting towards mid-range and premium models from players like Samsung, LG, and Sony. Anshika Jain, a senior analyst at Counterpoint, commented, \"The reason for the decline in the shipments of Chinese brands is due to the consumer preference for the mid-segment and premium models from Samsung, LG, and Sony, and also growing interest towards other brands like Sansui and Acer as we have seen frequent upgrades happening in the market, expanding the choices for the customers.\"Pulkit Baid, director of Great Eastern Retail, noted that the television market is undergoing consolidation and correction. He stated, \"While brands like Llyod are getting aggressive, the Chinese brands, which had earlier penetrated significantly, are now wrapping up their losses.\"In the smartphone sector, Chinese brands have been steadily losing market share for four consecutive quarters. They are moving away from the entry-level segment, priced below Rs 7,000-8,000, where they once dominated, and are now focusing on competing with Samsung, Apple, and others in the mid-to-premium range to enhance profitability.Chinese brands remain dominant in the smartphone market, but in the TV segment, they face fewer competitors, creating opportunities for other brands to gain traction.From 2017-18, Chinese brands such as Xiaomi, OnePlus, Realme, TCL, and iFfalcon disrupted the Indian TV market by offering models at significantly lower prices, challenging established players like LG, Samsung, and Sony. This fierce price competition led to the exit or reduced emphasis of major brands on entry-level models.Avneet Singh Marwah, CEO of SPPL, which holds licenses to sell Kodak, Thomson, and Blaupunkt television brands in India, explained, \"The strategy of the Chinese TV brands was to cut prices to gain quick market share. This increased their losses. Plus, television panel prices have become so volatile that it is very difficult to generate profit without dedicated focus.\" Marwah added that Chinese brands are now turning their attention to their primary product—smartphones, presenting an opportunity for other brands like the ones he sells to gain market share.',\n",
       " \"NEW DELHI: India pacer Mohammed Shami delivered a stunning inswinger to floor the leg stump of ace Australia batter Steve Smith in the first One-Day International (ODI) of the three-match series on Friday at Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali.When skipper KL Rahul gave Shami his second spell, Smith was well set in the middle, already batting on 41, and India needed another breakthrough after David Warner's dismissal to turn the tide as Australia looked settled for a big total at 111 for 2 after 21 overs. A single was taken off the first delivery by Marnus Labuschagne, and Smith played a defensive off-side shot off the second. The third delivery nipped into the stumps sharply after landing outside off stump line. Smith went for a drive but was a tad late and the ball took an inside edge before flooring the leg stump to the ground.And with it India got a massive breakthrough as Smith departed after scoring 41 off 60 balls, which included a six and three fours. Smith also added a crucial 94 runs for the second wicket with Warner (52) for the Aussies after losing Mitchell Marsh early in the first over to Shami. India skipper KL Rahul won the toss and opted to bowl first against Australia. Rahul is leading India in two of the three ODIs, with regular captain Rohit Sharma resting ahead of the World Cup, which begins next month.Ravichandran Ashwin, India's experienced off-spinner, has returned to the ODI squad, with selectors exploring alternatives if left-arm spinner Axar Patel fails to recuperate in time for the World Cup.Australian skipper Pat Cummins, who has returned from a wrist injury, gave Matthew Short, who was added to the team due to Travis Head's injury, his ODI debut in the game.\",\n",

       " 'HANGZHOU: In a major development on Friday, India\\'s Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports, Anurag Thakur, cancelled his scheduled visit to the Asian Games here in protest of the \"differential treatment\" meted out to three wushu athletes, who faced visa and accreditation issues that has prevented them from travelling to China to participate in the continental showpiece.Three female wushu players from Arunachal Pradesh -- Nyeman Wangsu, Onilu Tega and Mepung Lamgu -- were not able to fly out with other members of the contingent that arrived in Hangzhou on Thursday morning. The trio faced issues in getting their accreditation validated and were reportedly issued stapled visas.The accreditation card acts as the visa for accredited athletes and personnel in order to travel to China for the Asian Games. The Government of India on Friday took a stern note of the development and reacted strongly in response, calling it a \"deliberate and selective obstruction\".Arindam Bagchi, the official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, said in a statement on microblogging website \\'X\\' (formerly Twitter), - \"The Government of India has learnt that the Chinese authorities have, in a targeted and premeditated manner, discriminated against some of the Indian sportspersons from the state of Arunachal Pradesh by denying them accreditation and entry to the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.\"In line with our longstanding and consistent position, India firmly rejects differential treatment of Indian citizens on the basis of domicile or ethnicity. Arunachal Pradesh was, is and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India.\"A strong protest has been lodged in New Delhi and Beijing against China\\'s deliberate and selective obstruction of some of our sportspersons. China\\'s action violates both the spirit of the Asian Games and the rules governing their conduct, which explicitly prohibits discrimination against competitors from member states.The statement added that Sports Minister Anurag Thakur will now not travel to China.\"Further, as a mark of our protest against the Chinese action, the Minister of Information and Broadcasting and Youth Affairs and Sports of India has cancelled his scheduled visit to China for the Games. The Government of India reserves the right to take suitable measures to safeguard our interests.\"Hours before this development in India, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and the Hangzhou Asian Games Organising Committee (HAGOC) were questioned about the issue at a press conference at the Games\\' Main Media Centre. Replying to the question, OCA\\'s honorary life vice-president Wei Jizhong claimed that the athletes were granted Chinese visas but that they \"did not accept\" it.\"China didn\\'t refuse any visa but the problem is that according to Chinese government regulations, we have the right to give them different kinds of visas.

       " 'BENGALURU: The Bengaluru Police has tightened security, especially in Tamil dominated areas. This comes amid protests in several parts of Karnataka over the Cauvery water dispute between Karnataka, including Bengaluru. These precautions were taken after protests erupted following the Supreme Court decision on Thursday to not interfere with the order of Cauvery Water Regulation Committee (CWRC) according to which Karnataka must release 5,000 cusecs of water per day to Tamil Nadu. Bengaluru Police commissioner B Dayananda held meetings with his subordinates and instructed all the deputy commissioners of police in the city to be on high alert and step up security in their respective jurisdictions especially in Tamil dominated areas to avoid any untoward incident. The police commissioner told PTI that all necessary security measures have been taken. Soon after the Supreme Court verdict on the Cauvery issue, several organisations took to the streets in Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka to register their protest. On Friday too, protests were staged by various outfits in some areas of the city such as KR Puram. Anticipating protests in the coming days as well, the police chief has directed all deputy commissioners of police to take necessary steps to maintain law and order. Officers have been asked to tighten security measures in their respective jurisdictions based on intelligence reports about possible protests and violence in the coming days due to the Cauvery river water dispute. Farmer organizations and pro-Kannada groups may stage protests at various places which may lead to traffic congestion and inconvenience to the public at large, a senior police official said. Officers have been instructed to ensure that no incident of stone pelting takes place on any Tamil Nadu registered buses or private vehicles, he said. Farmer organizations and pro-Kannada outfits staged protests in Cauvery river basin districts like Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagara and Ramanagara expressing their anger and urging the state government not to release water to the neighboring state. Protests have also spread to other districts including Chitradurga, Ballari, Davangere, Koppal and Vijayapura.With PTI inputs',\n",

The trio faced issues in getting their accreditation validated and were reportedly issued stapled visas.The accreditation card acts as the visa for accredited athletes and personnel in order to travel to China for the Asian Games.

       " \"BATHINDA: Slain gangster-terrorist Sukhdool Singh Gill, aka Sukha Duneke, started out small in 2005, cutting his teeth in crime with petty jobs before graduating to running an extortion racket and carrying out targeted killings from Canada.Thirty-something Sukha, whose roots lie in the nondescript Duneke village of Punjab's Moga district that finds mention in his alias, spent 18 years of his life chasing notoriety before meeting a bloody end in Canada's Winnipeg on Thursday. Known to be a close associate of Arshdeep Singh, alias Arsh Dala, who hails from Dala village in Moga, Sukha was a chip off the old Bambiha gang, originally headed by Davinder Bambiha. Davinder, who was from Bathinda, was killed in an encounter on September 9, 2016, in a paddy field of Gill Kalan village in Bathinda.After Davinder's death, some of his gang members migrated abroad. Sukha, who had seven cases against his name at the time, used his clout to get his application for a second passport verified by police and left for Canada in 2017, sources said.India-Canada News live updatesIn Canada, Sukha came in contact with Arsh, who is believed to have been in touch with slain Khalistan Tiger Force head Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The NIA, in an FIR filed on June 10, 2021, under UAPA, said Arsh and other criminals had been extorting and killing in Punjab at Nijjar's behest.On August 26 last year, Sukha and a few other criminals were charged under UAPA with forming a group to recruit youth in India for criminal acts, including killings. In Canada, Sukha was named in the killing of UK-based kabaddi player Sandeep Nangal Ambian in March 2022. It is only after the murders of Ambian and rapper Sidhu Moose Wala in May that intelligence agencies started looking into records and passports of gangsters residing in foreign countries. Arsh and Sukha were found to be the prime suspects in several instances of crime.Punjab Police's anti-gangster taskforce discovered that Sukha had got a second passport issued with the connivance of some cops posted in Moga despite already having one that had been confiscated. In 2022, two cops were charged with clearing Sukha's passport application by bending rules.Moga SSP J Elenchezhian said the police were trying to get details of how Sukha entered the world of crime and his involvement in criminal activities while in Punjab and later in Canada. His mother and sister lived with him in Canada.Residents of Duneke village are reluctant to talk about Sukha and his family beyond the known facts such as the slain gangster's father being a government employee before he died. Sukha had apparently got a job in the Moga DC's office after his father's death, but he didn't last long there.\",\n",
       " \"HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Friday dismissed the petition filed by former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu seeking to quash the FIR registered against him in the alleged Skill development scam by the Crime Investigation Department (CID). The high court observed that the investigation is on fulcrum of attaining finality and it is not inclined to interfere with the impugned proceedings at this stage.Naidu's counsels contended that the registration of FIR was not done in accordance with the procedure contemplated in section 17A of Prevention of Corruption Act (PC Act). On the other hand, the CID counsels argued that the petition should not be entertained as the protection under 17A is not an absolute bar on registration of crime. They have also argued that the power under section 482 of CrPC should be exercised sparingly in rare and exceptional cases only.Dealing with legal aspects in the arguments on both sides, Justice K Srinivasa Reddy observed that the Supreme Court laid down parameters for exercise of jurisdiction under section 482 CrPC and none of the parameters laid down by the apex court for interference by this court at this stage has been made out.Justice Srinivasa Reddy further noted that the high court is of the opinion that irrespective of the disputed questions of fact, a mini trial cannot be conducted by this court in a petition filed under section 482 CrPC.

       " 'Thousands of job seekers, including graduates from top-tier engineering and management institutes, are finding themselves impacted by what market experts are labeling a \"fresher glut”, according to an ET report. This glut results from a surge in the talent pool of young professionals, comprising recent graduates and those with one to two years of experience.Recently, a fresh Vellore Institute of Technology graduate secured a placement with an American e-commerce giant in January, boasting a promised cost-to-company (CTC) package of approximately Rs 50 lakh post-confirmation. The CTC encompassed all perks, benefits, and restricted stock units. However, a few months into the internship, the pre-placement offer was abruptly canceled with the company citing role unavailability, the report quoted S Pasupathi, the chief operating officer at HirePro saying. The recruitment firm is now aiding the graduate in securing alternative employment. This year, the pool has notably expanded due to a higher-than-usual influx of candidates from the 2022 batch of engineers and B-school graduates seeking job changes in sectors like consulting, IT services, and startups. This influx compounds the situation for the 2023 batch of freshers whose final job offers face delays or cancellations.According to data from HirePro, nearly 45% of candidates from the 2022 batch are currently actively seeking employment, compared to the usual 25% in a typical year. The uncertain global macroeconomic climate has compelled companies to trim jobs and tighten recruitment processes to cut costs. S Pasupathi stated, \"Our estimates suggest nearly 20-30% of the offers from the 2023 batch are delayed or revoked.\"This scenario leads to direct competition between the 2022 and 2023 batches, with the looming presence of the 2024 batch entering the job market in a few months. Furthermore, previous batches hold an advantage, having gained on-job experience for a year or so, a factor valued by recruiters, he added.Experts predict that this situation will pose significant challenges for fresher placements in the Class of 2024. Many recruiters seek candidates with a few years of experience who can quickly adapt to their roles, particularly in technology-related sectors and startups, where maintaining a non-billable bench is unsustainable.This predicament unfolds just ahead of the upcoming placement season at business schools and engineering institutes. Tier-1 institutions may experience a milder impact, while tier-2 and tier-3 institutes are likely to be more affected, according to experts.Ciel HR Services CEO Aditya Narayan Mishra noted, \"Our estimates show a decline in hiring of freshers by about 15-20% for the batch which graduated in June-July 2023 compared to a year ago.\" He attributed this decline to companies\\' focus on cost optimization and efficiency improvement. “We see many people who graduated in 2022 and 2023 have not yet found the jobs they aspired for,” he said.Sonal Arora, country manager at GI Group Holding India, observed an abundance of entry-level talent compared to pre-Covid times. She explained, \"It is indeed more than regular years. While 2022 was an exceptional year for fresher/entry level talent with high resurgence in demand, even compared to pre-Covid levels, the supply of talent is more than demand in many sectors like IT services, ITeS, startups, professional services, and consulting, which have been impacted by macroeconomic headwinds.\"',\n",

       " 'Korean women have long been heralded as pioneers in the world obsessed with skincare, celebrated for their unwavering commitment to achieving and maintaining youthful, luminous complexions. Central to their regimen is the ingenious incorporation of face masks, heralded as the secret weapon in their quest for ageless beauty.Korean women are known for their dedication to skincare, and they have popularized various skincare routines and products around the world. One of the key components of Korean skincare routines is the use of face masks.One popular type of face mask in Korean skincare is the sheet mask. Sheet masks are single-use masks that are typically made of a thin, cotton-like material soaked in a serum or essence. They come in various formulations targeting different skin concerns, such as hydration, brightening, firming, and anti-aging.While there isn\\'t a specific \"magic\" mask that guarantees eternal youth, many Korean sheet masks are formulated with ingredients like hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, vitamin C, and various botanical extracts, which are known for their hydrating, brightening, and anti-aging properties.Korean women often incorporate sheet masks into their skincare routines, using them regularly, sometimes even daily or a few times a week, as a way to provide an extra boost of nutrients and hydration to their skin. Why these sheet masks are so good?The sheet mask, is a marvel of innovation and simplicity. Comprising a delicate, serum-soaked fabric, these masks are saturated with potent formulations designed to infuse the skin with a symphony of revitalizing ingredients. The meticulous curation of these elixirs includes stalwarts like hyaluronic acid, a moisture-retaining powerhouse, and vitamin-rich botanical extracts known for their rejuvenating prowess.Korean women embrace these masks as a ritualistic practice, weaving them seamlessly into their daily skincare routine. It is not uncommon for these women to indulge in the restorative embrace of a face mask several times a week, or even daily, demonstrating a commitment to preserving youthful vitality that verges on the reverent.A cornerstone of the Korean approach to skincare is the conviction that prevention is as paramount as correction. Thus, these masks serve not only as a means to reverse the signs of aging but also as a proactive measure against their onset. Through regular application, the skin is fortified against the onslaught of environmental stressors, fortifying its resilience and perpetuating its youthful glow. The efficacy of these masks lies not only in their scientifically formulated serums but also in the method of delivery. By cocooning the face in a protective veil, the mask creates an occlusive environment, allowing the active ingredients to penetrate deeply and more effectively. This symbiosis between formulation and application is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship ingrained in Korean skincare.Moreover, the ritual of applying a face mask transcends the physical. It is an act of self-care, an opportunity for introspection, and a moment of reprieve from the demands of daily life. This holistic approach to skincare underscores the interconnectedness of inner well-being and outer radiance.',\n",

However, many have expressed reluctance to disrupt existing trade relationships with Beijing. But Ramaswamy asserted that there\\'s no time for terms like \"de-risking\" or \"diversifying.\" Instead, Ramaswamy is set to introduce a resolute \"pro-trade strategy for sensibly decoupling from China.\"Speaking to a gathering at a plastics manufacturing facility in New Albany, Ohio, Ramaswamy emphasized that our primary adversary today is not the USSR, which dissolved in 1990, but rather Communist China.The biotech entrepreneur contends that his trade-centric approach represents the only \"substantive\" effort among GOP candidates. He aims to modernize the Reagan Doctrine by shifting its focus from \"peace through strength\" to \"prosperity through peace.\"Ramaswamy emphasized the imperative of reducing reliance on Chinese-controlled pharmaceutical supply chains and increasing military spending as part of his strategy. He stressed that his approach offers a practical and clear path to declare economic independence from China while concurrently advancing domestic prosperity.The 38-year-old entrepreneur, whose popularity has been on the rise following his impressive performance in the first Republican presidential primary debate last month, elaborated on following key elements of his policy:Declaring Independence from the Climate Change Agenda: Ramaswamy criticized the climate change agenda as a \"farce\" and a \"hoax\" and pledged to declare independence from it.Increased Military Spending: Ramaswamy called for heightened military spending to enhance homeland defense capabilities.Moving Away from Chinese-controlled Pharmaceutical Supply Chains: Expressing concerns about potential contamination, he advocated distancing the United States from pharmaceutical supply chains controlled by China, especially regarding legal pharmaceuticals.Economic Independence from Taiwan: He proposed boosting the production of US semiconductors, the essential components powering phones, satellite systems, medical devices, and communication devices, to achieve economic independence from Taiwan.Ramaswamy pointed out the Chinese Communist Party\\'s tactics of building barriers for market entry when criticizing China and rolling out the red carpet for those who criticize the United States. He cited examples, including BlackRock\\'s CEO Larry Fink\\'s lobbying efforts, to illustrate this dynamic.\"Take BlackRock, the first asset manager ever to be granted the right to sell mutual funds as a foreign asset manager in China. How did they get it? It was only after BlackRock\\'s CEO Larry Fink lobbied in the United States for lowered listing standards for Chinese companies in the US,\" he claimed.He emphasized that, if elected as President in November 2024, he would focus on achieving economic independence from China and highlighted the president\\'s unique role in shaping foreign policy.Ramaswamy stressed his commitment to avoiding World War III, revitalizing national pride, and dismantling regulatory obstacles under the executive branch, without having to rely on Congress for approval or forgiveness. He cautioned against making legislative promises contingent on Congress, referencing former President Donald Trump\\'s unfulfilled pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare as an example of such challenges.(With inputs from agencies)',\n",

       " 'Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL), India’s longest sea bridge, is nearing completion with 96.60% work complete. Dr Sanjay Mukherjee, IAS and Commissioner of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) recently did a comprehensive inspection of the mammoth project. The MTHL spans 21.8 kilometers in length with over 16 kilometers long stretch over the sea. It connects Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and commuters will be able to traverse between the two places in just 20 minutes with signal free connectivity. The MTHL will eventually provide faster connectivity to the Mumbai-Goa highway, Mumbai-Pune expressway, Navi Mumbai International Airport and the JNPT port.As part of the inspection, Dr Mukherjee held a meeting with the stakeholders and reviewed the progress of the project. Dr Mukherjee expressed satisfaction at the progress of this ambitious project and said that the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link is a significant milestone in the development of the region. MMRDA aims to complete the project within the stipulated time and hopes that it will be successfully integrated into the transportation network of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. Some of the unique features of the MTHL include automated toll collection system and intelligent transport system. The Mumbai Trans Harbour Link project is being implemented in three civil works packages while package 4 will focus on the Intelligent Transport System (ITS), Automated Toll collection system, and electrical works. The bridge has Orthotropic steel deck (OSD) spans ranging from 65 meters to 180 meters in length - something that MMRDA says is a first for India. Yet another important aspect of MTHL, as highlighted by Dr Mukherjee, is that the lighting poles installed on the bridge have been designed to withstand weather related challenges in the deep sea. A total of 1,212 lighting poles will be installed of which 20% have already been put in place. The poles are equipped with a Central Control Monitoring System (CCMS) and will be suitable to survive the saline environment. They have a corrosion-free polyurethane coating, galvanization to prevent rust and prolong lifespan, and structural design to withstand high wind velocities. Also, the lighting poles will have a Lightning Protection System to prevent potential damage caused by lightning.Earlier this year, Dr Mukjherjee in an exclusive interview with TOI had said that the MTHL and its associated connecting projects will increase the state GDP by at least 5%. “They are estimated to increase the national GDP by 1%. So, that itself tells us what is the potential that this one bridge has. And this bridge is therefore called a game changer,” he had said. “Navi Mumbai was developed way back as the satellite city of Mumbai and it was connected by two bridges. One is the Thane Creek bridge and the other one is the Airoli bridge. This (MTHL) actually makes Mumbai the closest to Navi Mumbai and it connects the area called as Shivri in Mumbai to an area called as Uluwe, Chirude in Navi Mumbai,” Mukherjee had explained.According to Mukherjee, the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link project has been built with the most modern technology. It’s been built for a lifespan of 100 years, using Japanese state-of-the-art technology. The almost Rs 18,000 crore project has been majorly funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).',\n",
       " 'Picture this: A young professional embarks on a journey into the world of management studies. They enroll in a reputable programme that imparts impressive knowledge and hone their leadership capabilities. Through rigorous coursework, real-world case studies, and collaborative projects, they master a deep understanding of business strategies and the art of effective execution. As they progress in their studies, they realise the importance of staying ahead of the curve. In the dynamic area of business, change is constant. Strategies that worked yesterday will be obsolete today. This realisation drives them to advance and enhance their expertise continuously. They need to upskill and learn new ways that will keep them at the top of their game.Therefore, leaders today require a comprehensive management programme that can help them upskill and empower them to reach higher levels of proficiency and leadership in the world of business and management.

       " 'JPMorgan has made a significant decision to include India in the Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) index after nearly two years of monitoring. This move is highly anticipated and is expected to have several positive impacts. India\\'s inclusion in this prominent and widely-followed bond index will lower its borrowing costs and attract passive investments of approximately $30 billion into the domestic debt market, according to an ET report. This development is also likely to stabilize the Indian rupee, reduce interest rates, lower bond yields, and subsequently reduce the cost of borrowing which will be a boost for the bottomline of companies.Mukesh Kochar, National Head - Wealth at AUM Capital, highlighted, \"This will reset the base rate for India and the yield should come down sharply. India\\'s cost of borrowing will come down. Since Covid, the fiscal deficit in India has remained elevated due to higher borrowing. This event will ease borrowing pressure as a large part of the borrowing will be observed by this route. Banks\\' Treasury will be flushed with mark-to-market gains.\"Additionally, the Indian rupee is poised to benefit from a significant inflow of dollars resulting from the purchase of government securities.In terms of the equity market, this development is seen as positive for banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), and leveraged companies. Mukesh Kochar stated, \"By and large it is a big macro positive for India.\" India will enter the global bond index with a 10% weight cap and other smaller JPM EM indices gradually over a 10-month period starting from June 28, 2024. Market experts estimate that this move could trigger passive inflows of approximately $30 billion.Emkay Global\\'s lead economist, Madhavi Arora, emphasized that this inclusion will structurally reduce India\\'s risk premia and cost of funding, enhance the liquidity and ownership base of government securities, and assist India in financing its fiscal and current account deficits.Most corporate bond yields are tied to government bond yields, so the decline in yields will have a widespread impact across industries. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, explained, \"Therefore, yields will decline pan India, across industries. The decline in the cost of capital will translate into higher profits for the corporate sector, which, in turn, will boost stock prices enabling the stock market to scale higher levels.\"The passive inflows resulting from India\\'s inclusion are expected to elevate India\\'s international standing and further strengthen its local fundamentals. Axis Mutual Fund anticipates that this move will prompt the RBI to conduct sterilization operations, fortifying forex reserves and the currency. It may also open doors for long-term debt capital to support India\\'s extensive infrastructure and development requirements.India\\'s bond market, currently the third largest among emerging markets (EMs) after China, boasts a market capitalization of over $1.2 trillion, nearly triple that of Indonesia\\'s and comparable to Brazil\\'s. However, foreign portfolio investment (FPI) ownership of India Government Securities (G-Secs) is less than 2%, significantly lower than EM peers.With Russia\\'s exclusion and issues in China, global debt investors\\' options have become more limited, analysts have noted.Banking industry veteran Keki Mistry believes that India’s inclusion will also help enhance its forex reserves. “Our forex reserves were at one time nearly $600 billion and they came down to about $550 billion odd a few months ago. But in the last six months or so, we recouped all those losses and we have come back to a reserve position close to $600 billion. So this would only further improve that,” he said.However, JPMorgan\\'s inclusion of India in the bond index does not immediately guarantee inclusion in FTSE and Bloomberg indexes, as these have stricter conditions related to FPI taxation and Euroclear requirements. Madhavi Arora pointed out, \"Changes to laws for taxing FPI capital gains, which would have helped India adhere to Euroclear requirements, were not a major impediment for India’s inclusion in the JPM index. However, this is still a major stumbling block for the Bloomberg indices, though not so much for the FTSE indices.\"Recent progress in addressing operational issues, such as margin requirements and extended settlement times, has played a crucial role in India securing inclusion in the JPM GBI-EM index. The removal of Russia from the index has also contributed to making the index slightly more concentrated, with India\\'s inclusion helping to diversify holdings, the economist added.',\n",
       " \"NEW DELHI: India pacer Mohammed Shami delivered a stunning inswinger to floor the leg stump of ace Australia batter Steve Smith in the first One-Day International (ODI) of the three-match series on Friday at Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali.When skipper KL Rahul gave Shami his second spell, Smith was well set in the middle, already batting on 41, and India needed another breakthrough after David Warner's dismissal to turn the tide as Australia looked settled for a big total at 111 for 2 after 21 overs. A single was taken off the first delivery by Marnus Labuschagne, and Smith played a defensive off-side shot off the second. The third delivery nipped into the stumps sharply after landing outside off stump line. Smith went for a drive but was a tad late and the ball took an inside edge before flooring the leg stump to the ground.And with it India got a massive breakthrough as Smith departed after scoring 41 off 60 balls, which included a six and three fours. Smith also added a crucial 94 runs for the second wicket with Warner (52) for the Aussies after losing Mitchell Marsh early in the first over to Shami. India skipper KL Rahul won the toss and opted to bowl first against Australia. Rahul is leading India in two of the three ODIs, with regular captain Rohit Sharma resting ahead of the World Cup, which begins next month.Ravichandran Ashwin, India's experienced off-spinner, has returned to the ODI squad, with selectors exploring alternatives if left-arm spinner Axar Patel fails to recuperate in time for the World Cup.Australian skipper Pat Cummins, who has returned from a wrist injury, gave Matthew Short, who was added to the team due to Travis Head's injury, his ODI debut in the game.\",\n",

However, despite the fact that 'Gadar 2' faced competition from 'Jawan', it has managed to have the highest nett collections by the end of this week. As per boxofficeindia.com, 'Gadar 2' has made Rs 513 crore nett and beaten the numbers of 'Baahubali - The Conclusion' and 'Pathaan'. Just the week 6 collection of the movie is around 2.75 crore. Shah Rukh Khan starrer 'Jawan' will beat its collections but yet, 'Gadar 2' will be the biggest hit of the year and it is likely to remain so till the end of the year, unless a big surprise springs in. As far as individual circuits are concerned, it has set record in areas like Delhi, UP, East Punjab, Rajasthan and Bihar. But due to the release of 'Jawan', the numbers of 'Gadar 2' have fallen short in comparison to 'Baahubali', as the collections went down post September 7.

The high court observed that the investigation is on fulcrum of attaining finality and it is not inclined to interfere with the impugned proceedings at this stage.Naidu's counsels contended that the registration of FIR was not done in accordance with the procedure contemplated in section 17A of Prevention of Corruption Act (PC Act). On the other hand, the CID counsels argued that the petition should not be entertained as the protection under 17A is not an absolute bar on registration of crime. They have also argued that the power under section 482 of CrPC should be exercised sparingly in rare and exceptional cases only.Dealing with legal aspects in the arguments on both sides, Justice K Srinivasa Reddy observed that the Supreme Court laid down parameters for exercise of jurisdiction under section 482 CrPC and none of the parameters laid down by the apex court for interference by this court at this stage has been made out.Justice Srinivasa Reddy further noted that the high court is of the opinion that irrespective of the disputed questions of fact, a mini trial cannot be conducted by this court in a petition filed under section 482 CrPC. The investigating agency, pursuant to the registration of the crime in the year 2021, examined as many as more than 140 witnesses and collected documents to the tune of more than 4000, he said adding that profligacy is such an esoteric subject, where investigation has to be carried with utmost proficiency by the professionals and hence the consequential reliefs sought are dismissed, said the high court.Court grants CID 2-day custodyA court on Friday granted two days custody of Naidu to CID for further interrogation in connection with the Skill Development Corporation scam.

This comes amid protests in several parts of Karnataka over the Cauvery water dispute between Karnataka, including Bengaluru. These precautions were taken after protests erupted following the Supreme Court decision on Thursday to not interfere with the order of Cauvery Water Regulation Committee (CWRC) according to which Karnataka must release 5,000 cusecs of water per day to Tamil Nadu. Bengaluru Police commissioner B Dayananda held meetings with his subordinates and instructed all the deputy commissioners of police in the city to be on high alert and step up security in their respective jurisdictions especially in Tamil dominated areas to avoid any untoward incident. The police commissioner told PTI that all necessary security measures have been taken. Soon after the Supreme Court verdict on the Cauvery issue, several organisations took to the streets in Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka to register their protest. On Friday too, protests were staged by various outfits in some areas of the city such as KR Puram. Anticipating protests in the coming days as well, the police chief has directed all deputy commissioners of police to take necessary steps to maintain law and order. Officers have been asked to tighten security measures in their respective jurisdictions based on intelligence reports about possible protests and violence in the coming days due to the Cauvery river water dispute. Farmer organizations and pro-Kannada groups may stage protests at various places which may lead to traffic congestion and inconvenience to the public at large, a senior police official said. Officers have been instructed to ensure that no incident of stone pelting takes place on any Tamil Nadu registered buses or private vehicles, he said. Farmer organizations and pro-Kannada outfits staged protests in Cauvery river basin districts like Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagara and Ramanagara expressing their anger and urging the state government not to release water to the neighboring state. Protests have also spread to other districts including Chitradurga, Ballari, Davangere, Koppal and Vijayapura.With PTI inputs',\n",

       " \"NEW DELHI: In a big boost for the Modi government's 'Make-in-India' initiative, Apple has overtaken Samsung to emerge as the largest smartphone exporter from India.According to a report in the Economic Times, Apple shipped 49% of the country’s total 12 million shipments in the June quarter compared to its Korean rival's 45%.Apple's share of exports soared from just 9% of the roughly 8 million smartphones shipped in Q2 2022, to almost half the total smartphone exports in Q2 2023, the ET report said. Meanwhile, exports from other Android brands such as Xiaomi, Motorola, Vivo, and Transsion witnessed a decrease, sliding from 10% in the first quarter of 2023 to 6% in the second quarter of 2023, the report said.Although India's contribution to iPhone production is relatively modest, the increasing exports present a promising development in line with PM Modi's aspirations to position the country as a viable alternative to China as a global manufacturing hub. Apple, which had historically relied heavily on China for iPhone manufacturing, is actively exploring alternative options due to escalating tensions between the Xi Jinping-led administration and the US government.Additionally, China's imposition of lockdowns that have disrupted economic operations too prompted Apple to diversify its manufacturing base.According to the ET report, Apple's impressive performance in India since commencing manufacturing activities in 2017 can be attributed to the substantial increase in production carried out by three of its contract manufacturers: Foxconn, Wistron, and Pegatron. This production surge began in the latter half of 2022, coinciding with the manufacturing of iPhone models up to the iPhone 14. This expansion aims to meet the rising demand in the Indian market and support export operations. It's noteworthy that all three manufacturers are participants in the Indian government's production-linked incentive scheme for smartphone manufacturing, the ET report said.Apple, the world's most valuable company, embarked on the assembly of its latest iPhone models in India just last year.Apart from boosting its exports from India, Apple is also set to increase its foothold in the local smartphone market. According to a Reuters report, Apple is anticipated to capture a larger portion of India's smartphone market, particularly with the upscale iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models gaining a more substantial share of its shipments.According to data provided exclusively to Reuters by market research firm Counterpoint, the company is expected to secure 7% of the total smartphone sales in India between July and December. This marks an increase from the 5% it held in the first half of 2023.Apple has been actively positioning India as a pivotal driver of its future growth, a strategic move aimed at countering the declining sales of its flagship device.Notably, Apple already dominates the segment for smartphones priced over $800 in India, holding a commanding 67% share in the first half, as reported by IDC data.

       " 'KYIV: Ukraine carried out a fiery missile strike on Friday on the main headquarters of Russia\\'s Black Sea Fleet, a Russian official said. Videos and photos showed large plumes of smoke over the building in Sevastopol in annexed Crimea. The Russian-installed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said there was no information about casualties. He said firefighters were battling a blaze, and more emergency forces were being brought in, an indication that the fire could be massive. A stream of ambulances were arriving at the fleet\\'s headquarters and shrapnel was scattered hundreds of metres (yards) around, the Tass news agency reported. Razvozhayev initially warned Sevastopol residents that another attack was possible and urged them not to leave buildings or go to the city centre. He later said there was no longer any air strike danger but reiterated calls not to go to the central part of the city, saying roads were closed and and unspecified \"special efforts\" were underway. Ukrainian officials, who have claimed responsibility for a series of other recent attacks on Crimea, didn\\'t immediately announce Kyiv launched the strike. Sevastopol residents said they heard explosions in the skies and saw smoke, Russian news outlets reported. Images circulated in Ukrainian Telegram channels showed clouds of smoke over the seafront. The Associated Press could not immediately verify the videos. The attack comes a day after Russian missiles and artillery pounded cities across Ukraine, killing at least five people as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President Joe Biden and congressional leaders in Washington with an additional USD 24 billion aid package being considered. The port city of Sevastopol serves as the main base for Russia\\'s Black Sea Fleet. Last week, the Russian-installed authorities there accused Ukraine of attacking a strategic shipyard in the city, damaging two ships undergoing repairs and causing a fire at the facility. The Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in an act that most of the world considered illegal, has been a frequent target since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than 18 months ago. The attack on the shipyard was the biggest in weeks. In other developments, ongoing shelling in the southern Kherson region killed one man and injured another, said regional Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin. \"Kherson has been restless since the morning,\" he said on Telegram. Russian shelling sparked fires in a residential building and a garage. In Kharkiv, regional Gov. Oleh Synyehubov said over 14 settlements came under attack. A house was damaged and a fire broke out in Vovchansk, in Chuguyiv district. There were no casualties, the governor said.',\n",
       " \"Indian higher education institutions are struggling to meet the expectations of the contemporary challenges and need for modern skills with a curriculum that was revamped almost four decades ago. The curriculum is the backbone of an education system, which requires regular tunings with the evolving socio-economic and other factors. India, which surpassed China as the most populous country in April 2023, is a human resource-intensive country and needs a skilled workforce to power up the economy. According to a research paper published in ResearchGate on “Curriculum Reforms in Higher Education of India for Employability, Entrepreneurship and Skill Development,” essential steps to reform Indian Higher Education Institutions are:Planning and restructuring the curriculum to ensure effective learning and teaching to improve the overall standards of educationEquipping students with practical and technical skills in the field of their interest. Skilling should begin at an early age and continue in higher education.Drafting a job-oriented curriculum to fulfill the needs and aspirations of the studentsImproving employability and encouraging entrepreneurship with internships, vocational training, boot camps, workshops, and moreUpskilling teaching faculty with workshops and training to make them tech-aware and hire tech-savvy new facultySeminars, trainings and workshops to exchange ideas, discourse on effective teaching methods and moreIn a welcome move to improve the higher education system and institutions, the Ministry of HRD launched the National Education Policy on 30 July 2020. It will come into effect from the current academic year 2023-24. NEP will be a game-changer in the Indian education system with the motto “Educate, Encourage, Enlighten.” It will replace the National Policy on Education 1986, launched by Shri Rajiv Gandhi. Key highlights of NEP 2020 for higher education:GER in higher education to be raised to 50% by 2035, and 3.5 crore seats to be added in higher education Flexibility of subjects in higher education curriculum Multiple entries and exits with appropriate certification An Academic Bank of Credits is to be established to facilitate the Transfer of Credits. National Research Foundation to be established to foster a strong research culture Affiliation system to be phased out in 15 years with graded autonomy to colleges National Educational Technology Forum to be created for higher use of technology with equity Special Education Zones, Gender Inclusion Funds and other initiatives for disadvantaged regions and groups National Institute of Pali, Persian, and Prakrit, Indian Institute of Translation and Interpretation to be set up for promoting multilingualism at schools and higher education institutions In an exclusive chat with Prof. (Dr.) G.K. Prabhu, President, Manipal University Jaipur (MUJ), spoke about reforms MUJ plans to make in the curriculum for the academic session 2023-24. He said, “We keep hearing that students passing out of higher education institutions are not employable. Around 75% of engineers are considered unemployable. The reasons behind this might be that we teach something which is not relevant.” “We at Manipal University Jaipur and Manipal Group of Universities would like to bring relevance in the curriculum that prepares students with future skills that ensure readiness for the job market not only at present but after four years when they will graduate.” He continued, “We are using National Education Policy to make our vision a reality to make the curriculum competent, relevant and flexible. He also wants to integrate the fun factor into the education system by adding an experiential part to learning. However, fun should be responsible for a holistic growth and successful future.” National Education Policy 2020 is a welcome step towards fulfilling the need for a curriculum revamp for the higher education system and institutions. These reforms will prepare students with future skills for challenges in the tech era. In addition to the reforms proposed in NEP and recommendations in the paper published in ResearchGate, the Government of India can implement certain things to enhance the effectiveness of the curriculum at Indian higher education institutions. These include: ● Giving more autonomy to universities to enhance their curriculum, upskill existing faculty and hire new faculty with their standards ● Supporting universities to create advanced research facilities and encourage innovations ● Making higher education affordable and accessible for students from all backgrounds ● Focus on higher education institutions in Tier II, Tier III and rural areas. India needs massive curriculum reforms, and these steps will prepare students with future skills and improve employability. It’s time to reclaim the much-deserving ‘Vishwa Guru’ title. Let’s conclude with a quote from the farewell speech of Ex-President Ram Nath Kovind, “The 21st Century will be India’s, and the National Education Policy lays down the path for the same along with health and economic sector reforms.”Disclaimer: The article has been produced on behalf of Manipal University Jaipur by the Times Internet's Spotlight team.\",\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday dismissed a petition by real estate company Supertech\\'s chairman and owner RK Arora in a money laundering case.Arora had challenged his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Justice Dinesh Kumar Sharma rejected Arora\\'s claim that he was arrested \"arbitrarily and illegally\" on June 27 without being informed about the grounds of arrest, noting the agency complied with the relevant provisions of law.\"In the present case, the grounds of arrest were duly given and notified to the petitioner and he endorsed the same in writing under his signature. The core issue is of being \\'informed\\' and \\'as soon as\\'. It if has been duly notified and brought to the notice at the time of arrest and further disclosed in detail in the remand application, it amounts to be duly informed and served,\" PTI quoted the court as saying in its order.\"The petition along with pending applications stands dismissed,\" the court said.On June 27, the ED had arrested Arora on money-laundering charges, following a third round of questioning at its office here.The money-laundering case against the Supertech group, its directors and promoters stems from a clutch of FIRs registered by the Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh police.Arora argued before the high court that ED acted in violation of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and his fundamental right under Article 22(1) of the Constitution of India as he was arrested without being informed/communicated/served the grounds of arrest. He claimed he was also denied the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice.The court said there was no violation of the petitioner\\'s fundamental rights and \"there is nothing on the record to suggest that petitioner has been denied the right to consult and be defended by legal practitioner\".\"There is nothing on record to suggest that \\'reason to believe\\' as required under Section 19(1) of the PMLA was not recorded in writing and, therefore, it cannot be held that the petitioner was arrested illegally. The petitioner here failed to show that the arrest of the petitioner is in violation of Section 19 of the PMLA,\" it added.Arora said his arrest has jeopardized the interest of almost 17,000 home buyers as well as a Settlement-cum-Resolution Plan approved by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal which was also given the go-ahead by the Supreme Court.The court said the petitioner cannot be released on interim bail in the present proceedings and \"it would be impractical\" to send him to Mumbai in custody for attending the meetings with the financial creditors.Even for releasing the petitioner on interim bail, the rigors of PMLA have to be satisfied, the court said, adding if he so desires, the jail superintendent may arrange a meeting through video conferencing from the jail itself in accordance with the law.On August 24, the ED had filed a charge sheet against Arora, now in judicial custody, his company, and eight others in a money laundering case, accusing them of hatching a criminal conspiracy to cheat home buyers.They were accused of defrauding at least 670 home buyers of Rs 164 crore.The nearly 100-page prosecution complaint, ED\\'s equivalent of charge sheet, was filed before Special Judge Devender Kumar Jangala, claiming there was sufficient evidence to prosecute Arora for laundering money.The agency informed the trial court that the matter arose from 26 FIRs registered by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh police against Supertech Ltd. and its group companies for alleged criminal conspiracy, cheating, criminal breach of trust and forgery.According to the charge sheet, the company and its directors hatched a \"criminal conspiracy\" to cheat people by collecting funds from prospective home buyers as advance against flats booked in their real estate projects.The company allegedly did not adhere to the agreed obligation of providing possession of the flats on time and \"defrauded\" the general public, the agency said, adding the funds were collected by Supertech Limited and other group companies.The company also took project-specific term loans from banks and financial institutions for the purpose of construction of housing projects, the ED said.However, these funds were \"misappropriated and diverted\" for buying land in the name of other group companies which were pledged as collateral to borrow funds from banks and financial institutions, it added.The Supertech group also defaulted on payments to banks and financial institutions, and currently around Rs 1,500 crore of such loans have become non-performing assets (NPA), the agency said.Supertech Ltd, which was formed in 1988, has so far delivered around 80,000 apartments, mainly in the Delhi-NCR region. The company is currently developing around 25 projects across the National Capital Region (NCR). It is yet to give possession to more than 20,000 customers.The company has been plagued by crisis since last year when in August its nearly 100-meter-tall twin towers - Apex and Ceyane - located on Noida Expressway, were demolished following an order of the Supreme Court which found they were constructed within the Emerald Court premises in violation of norms.Arora had then said the company incurred a loss of about Rs 500 crore, including construction and interest costs, because of the demolition.With PTI inputs',\n",

Supporters of various student groups enthusiastically chanted slogans at the campus intersection, echoing the election pledges of the student organizations competing in the Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) election.A total of 24 candidates are vying for positions in the DUSU polls, which are taking place after a three-year hiatus. Voting was permitted for day class students until 1 pm, while evening class students could cast their ballots from 3pm to 7.30pm.Approximately one lakh eligible students have the opportunity to vote in this election, which also serves as a launching pad for aspiring politicians. The election provides a vital platform for students to express their concerns, elect their representatives, and influence the direction of campus life for the upcoming academic year.Notably, the Ratan Tata Library and JP tea stall have become hotspots for discussions about the election. Even rickshaw pullers and autorickshaw drivers were engaged in conversations speculating on the potential outcomes of the student body election.Many first-year students captured the vibrant scenes on campus on their smartphones, taking selfies after participating in the electoral process.To ensure the security of the election proceedings, around 500 security personnel have been deployed in Delhi University's North Campus. Adequate security arrangements have also been put in place in the South Campus of the university. Over ten station house officers are overseeing security at the colleges, and 25 police motorcycles are patrolling the area.

       " 'WASHINGTON: Under pressure on world stage to produce evidence to back up its allegation that New Delhi is behind the assassination of an immigrant Sikh militant, the Canadian government has claimed in leaks to the media that it has \"both human and signals intelligence\" pointing to the involvement of Indian officials in the killing. The intelligence, which is said to also implicate Indian diplomats serving in Canada, did not come solely from Canada; some was provided by an unnamed ally in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported on Thursday night, citing unnamed government sources. Canada, US, UK, Australia, and New Zealand are members of the alliance. Signals intelligence would typically mean electronic eavesdropping; the unnamed Five Eyes ally, going by the vehemence with which Washington came out today in support of Canada, points to the United States. At a White House briefing, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Washington is consulting closely with Canada on the issue supports the efforts that they are undertaking in this investigation. The US has also been in touch with the Indian government, he added. Sullivan denied there was any \"wedge\" between the US and Canada on the issue and asserted that \"as soon as we heard from the Canadian prime minister publicly about the allegations, we went out publicly ourselves and expressed our deep concern about them, our support for a law enforcement process to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.\"\"We have deep concerns about the allegations, and we would like to see this investigation carried forward and the perpetrators held to account. That is what the United States has stood for from the moment this emerged in public, and we will continue to stand for that until this fully plays its way out,\" he added. Asked if President Biden intends to speak to PM Modi about the Canadian allegations and if the incident could drive a wedge between the US and India, Sullivan declined to get into \"private diplomatic conversations that have either already happened or are going to happen on this topic, only to say that we have been and will be in contact with the Indians at high levels on this issue.\" Sullivan\\'s national security counterpart in India is Ajit Doval.Although the US itself has carried out trans-national assassinations, including of its own citizens (notably Anwar al Awlaki, an Islamic scholar who was killed in Yemen in a Drone strike), Sullivan maintained that no country could get a free pass for such an action. \"It is a matter of concern for us. It is something we take seriously. It’s something we will keep working on, and we will do that regardless of the country. There is not some special exemption you get for actions like this. Regardless of the country, we will stand up and defend our basic principles. And we will also consult closely with allies like Canada as they pursue their law enforcement and diplomatic process,\" he said. The CBC report meanwhile cited \"Canadian sources\" saying that \"when pressed behind closed doors, no Indian official has denied the bombshell allegation at the core of this case — that there is evidence to suggest Indian government involvement in the assassination of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.\" New Delhi has said Canada has produced no evidence to back its allegations. Trudeau too has used the word allegations, not evidence, in accusing India of involvement. \"I can assure you that the decision to share these allegations on the floor of the House of Commons … was not done lightly,\" Trudeau said Thursday in New York after attending the United Nations General Assembly. \"It was done with the utmost seriousness.\"',\n",

       " 'JPMorgan has made a significant decision to include India in the Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) index after nearly two years of monitoring. This move is highly anticipated and is expected to have several positive impacts. India\\'s inclusion in this prominent and widely-followed bond index will lower its borrowing costs and attract passive investments of approximately $30 billion into the domestic debt market, according to an ET report. This development is also likely to stabilize the Indian rupee, reduce interest rates, lower bond yields, and subsequently reduce the cost of borrowing which will be a boost for the bottomline of companies.Mukesh Kochar, National Head - Wealth at AUM Capital, highlighted, \"This will reset the base rate for India and the yield should come down sharply. India\\'s cost of borrowing will come down. Since Covid, the fiscal deficit in India has remained elevated due to higher borrowing. This event will ease borrowing pressure as a large part of the borrowing will be observed by this route. Banks\\' Treasury will be flushed with mark-to-market gains.\"Additionally, the Indian rupee is poised to benefit from a significant inflow of dollars resulting from the purchase of government securities.In terms of the equity market, this development is seen as positive for banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), and leveraged companies. Mukesh Kochar stated, \"By and large it is a big macro positive for India.\" India will enter the global bond index with a 10% weight cap and other smaller JPM EM indices gradually over a 10-month period starting from June 28, 2024. Market experts estimate that this move could trigger passive inflows of approximately $30 billion.Emkay Global\\'s lead economist, Madhavi Arora, emphasized that this inclusion will structurally reduce India\\'s risk premia and cost of funding, enhance the liquidity and ownership base of government securities, and assist India in financing its fiscal and current account deficits.Most corporate bond yields are tied to government bond yields, so the decline in yields will have a widespread impact across industries. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, explained, \"Therefore, yields will decline pan India, across industries. The decline in the cost of capital will translate into higher profits for the corporate sector, which, in turn, will boost stock prices enabling the stock market to scale higher levels.\"The passive inflows resulting from India\\'s inclusion are expected to elevate India\\'s international standing and further strengthen its local fundamentals. Axis Mutual Fund anticipates that this move will prompt the RBI to conduct sterilization operations, fortifying forex reserves and the currency. It may also open doors for long-term debt capital to support India\\'s extensive infrastructure and development requirements.India\\'s bond market, currently the third largest among emerging markets (EMs) after China, boasts a market capitalization of over $1.2 trillion, nearly triple that of Indonesia\\'s and comparable to Brazil\\'s. However, foreign portfolio investment (FPI) ownership of India Government Securities (G-Secs) is less than 2%, significantly lower than EM peers.With Russia\\'s exclusion and issues in China, global debt investors\\' options have become more limited, analysts have noted.Banking industry veteran Keki Mistry believes that India’s inclusion will also help enhance its forex reserves. “Our forex reserves were at one time nearly $600 billion and they came down to about $550 billion odd a few months ago. But in the last six months or so, we recouped all those losses and we have come back to a reserve position close to $600 billion. So this would only further improve that,” he said.However, JPMorgan\\'s inclusion of India in the bond index does not immediately guarantee inclusion in FTSE and Bloomberg indexes, as these have stricter conditions related to FPI taxation and Euroclear requirements. Madhavi Arora pointed out, \"Changes to laws for taxing FPI capital gains, which would have helped India adhere to Euroclear requirements, were not a major impediment for India’s inclusion in the JPM index. However, this is still a major stumbling block for the Bloomberg indices, though not so much for the FTSE indices.\"Recent progress in addressing operational issues, such as margin requirements and extended settlement times, has played a crucial role in India securing inclusion in the JPM GBI-EM index. The removal of Russia from the index has also contributed to making the index slightly more concentrated, with India\\'s inclusion helping to diversify holdings, the economist added.',\n",

They are taking it up with the government and we are also taking it up with the government.\"Discrimination based on domicile: MEAThe development comes as the Ministry of External Affairs reacted to reports of discrimination by Chinese authorities.\"The government of India has learnt that the Chinese authorities have, in a targeted and pre-meditated manner, discriminated against some Indian sportspersons from the state of Arunachal Pradesh by denying them accreditation and entry to the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, China,\" said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.\"In line with our long-standing and consistent position, India firmly rejects differential treatment of Indian citizens based on domicile or ethnicity. Arunachal Pradesh was, is and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India. A strong protest has been lodged in New Delhi and Beijing against China\\'s deliberate and selective obstruction of some of our sportspersons,\" he added. The MEA said that China’s action violates both the spirit of the Asian Games and the rules governing their conduct, which explicitly prohibits discrimination against competitors from member states. \"As a mark of our protest against the Chinese action, the Union sports minister has cancelled his scheduled visit to China for the Games. The government of India reserves the right to take suitable measures to safeguard our interests,\" added Bagchi.Martial arts athletesSeveral media reports stated that three Indian martial arts athletes from Arunachal Pradesh have been forced to pull out of the Asian Games after not receiving clearance from the host country.The three women are wushu fighters. Wushu, or kung fu, is a multi-disciplinary martial art originating in China. The trio was approved to take part by the Hangzhou Asian Games Organising Committee but were unable to download their accreditation cards -- which act as visas to enter China. The rest of the 10-member squad along with the coaching staff left for the Games in Hangzhou on Wednesday. Past incidentThe Indian wushu team did not travel to the Chinese city of Chengdu for the World University Games in July this year after the same three athletes were issued stapled, rather than pasted, visas -- an indication that Beijing does not recognise India\\'s territorial claim over Arunachal Pradesh, said some media reports.The move triggered angry reactions from the Indian side with the foreign ministry saying it was \"unacceptable\".(With inputs from agencies)',\n",

He argued that reducing the NEET marks to zero percentile essentially allows all candidates who have taken the NEET-PG examination to secure a seat in private medical colleges, provided they have the financial means to do so. Dr. Ramadoss highlighted some alarming statistics, revealing that 30 candidates scored single-digit marks in the NEET-PG entrance exam, 14 candidates received zero marks, and 13 candidates even scored negative marks.According to him, all these students are now eligible for admission in private medical colleges. However, he emphasized that this approach would not enhance the quality of medical education in any way. Moreover, he pointed out that the majority of vacant PG seats are in private medical colleges. To address this issue and prevent a shortage of specialists, Dr Ramadoss called for private medical colleges to reduce their fees and for the government to conduct counselling for candidates who have already cleared the examination.MDMK leader Vaiko also criticized the NEET exam, describing it as an eyewash. He went a step further, characterizing NEET as a fraudulent examination and blaming it for the deaths of approximately 20 students in Tamil Nadu. Vaiko urged the Union government to discontinue the practice of conducting NEET.

       " 'KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court has provided temporary relief to TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee by instructing the Enforcement Directorate (ED) not to employ coercive measures against him within the context of their probe into the alleged school jobs scam in West Bengal. However, the court did not dismiss the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR), which is equivalent to an FIR, that had been filed by the ED against Banerjee.Justice Tirthankar Ghosh, presiding as a single bench, directed the ED to refrain from taking any coercive actions against the Trinamool Congress MP based on the ECIR. The court concluded that the evidence presented by the ED was insufficient to justify Banerjee\\'s arrest. Consequently, the ongoing investigation into Banerjee\\'s alleged involvement in irregularities related to the recruitment of teachers in government and government-sponsored schools will continue.Earlier this month, the TMC\\'s national general secretary was subjected to a lengthy nine-hour interrogation by the ED in connection with the West Bengal teacher recruitment scandal.The TMC welcomed the high court\\'s ruling, while opposition parties, such as the Congress and CPI(M), chose to withhold their comments.Kunal Ghosh, a TMC spokesperson, remarked, \"While we cannot directly comment on ongoing investigations and legal matters, this judgment underscores the fact that central agencies have been relentlessly pursuing and pressuring Banerjee, who plays a significant role in countering the BJP\\'s divisive and hate-driven political approach.\" Ghosh also added that the court has restrained the ED from further harassment, and Banerjee will continue to cooperate with investigators.Sashi Panja, a senior West Bengal minister and TMC leader, noted that despite Banerjee\\'s multiple appearances before central agencies, his ordeal persists.Congress leader Adhir Choudhury suggested that it would be prudent to wait for Banerjee\\'s acquittal by the court before making further comments, considering the court\\'s observations regarding the ED\\'s probe.Sujan Chakraborty, a central committee member of the CPI(M), expressed bewilderment at the need for Banerjee to seek so much legal protection if he is not guilty.In the meantime, senior BJP leader Rahul Sinha pointed out that the court has permitted the investigative agencies to continue their inquiry into Banerjee. He acknowledged Banerjee\\'s pursuit of legal safeguards but refrained from making further comments on judicial matters.(With inputs from PTI)',\n",
       " 'Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has tried to deflect attention away from his cosy political ties to radicals and his government’s indulgence of violence-espousing Khalistanis by seeking to put India in the dock with an astounding allegation. Trudeau’s evidence-free claim should not obscure a larger problem confronting India – the five Anglosphere countries’ sheltering of Khalistani extremists that endorse violence as a legitimate tool to achieve Khalistan.The Khalistan idea has few takers among Sikhs in India, as the highly regarded, Washington-based Pew Research Centre highlighted in a poll released in 2021. The survey found that 95% of Sikhs are “very proud to be Indians”. In fact, 70% of Sikhs believe “a person who disrespects India cannot be a Sikh”. Even in Canada and other English-speaking countries, Khalistan supporters make up just a fraction of the Sikh diaspora.Yet, an unholy combination of two factors is keeping Khalistan militancy alive overseas. The first is Pakistan’s funding, support and possible training of Khalistanis in a bid to destabilise India, as a Hudson Institute report brought out.More surprising is the role of Canada, UK, US, Australia and, marginally, New Zealand, as if no lesson has been learnt from the 1985 bombing by Khalistani extremists of an Air India flight from Toronto that killed all 329 people on board. These countries continue to look the other way as Khalistani radicals step up their militancy from Western soil, including issuing death threats and calls to violence. The inaction has emboldened the extremists to vandalise Indian diplomatic missions and Hindu temples, and threaten Indian diplomats.Long before Trudeau’s allegation plunged Indo-Canadian ties to their lowest ebb, New Delhi was urging the Anglosphere countries to rein in the rising tide of Khalistani militancy directed at India. Instead, what India got were nasty surprises – from militants storming the Indian high commission in London and dual attacks on the Indian consulate in San Francisco to an anti-India parade in Canada seeking to immortalise former PM Indira Gandhi’s assassins.Khalistani militancy is particularly acute in Canada, which explains why its British Columbia province has become the global hub of the Khalistan movement. With India’s patience wearing thin, PM Narendra Modi, in a frosty meeting with Trudeau during the G20 summit, gave him a dressing-down for being soft on Khalistani terrorists.To keep his minority government afloat, Trudeau depends on support from the New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh, a Khalistan sympathiser. With the tail wagging the dog, Trudeau has pandered to hardline Canadian Sikhs. Take just this example: Trudeau cheered on Indian farmers blockading highways near New Delhi and then later, in the style of an autocrat, declared a national emergency in Canada and crushed peaceful protests against his Covid vaccination policy, calling their blockades a security threat akin to terrorism.Yet, Trudeau refuses to act against the real terrorists in Canada that threaten Indian security. Harbouring violent extremists also threatens Canadian and international security because a day may come when Canadian Khalistani militants carry out a major terrorist strike within Canada or in another Western country.Canada’s record of shielding Khalistani terrorists is a case of “like father, like son”. Trudeau’s father, former PM Pierre Trudeau, turned down Indira Gandhi’s 1982 request for extradition of Babbar Khalsa chief Talwinder Parmar who, according to Canada’s official probe, went on to become the mastermind of the Air India flight bombing. Today, the growing nexus between Khalistani extremists and criminal bands in British Columbia has spawned gangland killings.In this light, Trudeau’s allegation against India clearly seems a diversionary tactic to help obscure sordid facts, including the continued cover he is giving to operations of Khalistani militants in the name of free speech. His allegation is based not on any police-collected evidence but on purported inputs from the murky world of espionage. In spy games, geopolitics often trumps facts.India should not allow Trudeau to deflect attention from Canada’s answerability on becoming a safe haven for militants promoting or glorifying terrorism. Canada cannot cite free speech law to defend inaction because it has other laws against hate or incitement to violence that ought to be invoked. Without curbing its Khalistani militancy, Canada could undermine its internal security, becoming one day the Pakistan of the West.Indian diplomacy must also exert sustained pressure on the other Anglosphere countries to stop countenancing the rising anti-India activities of extremist Khalistani groups operating from their territories. The paradox is that even as a tilt towards the West is becoming apparent in Indian foreign policy, the Anglosphere countries seem to be looking at the violent Khalistani extremists they shelter as potential leverage against India. Mutual respect and mutual security are indispensable to an informal alliance between the West and India.For starters, Canada and India must arrest the downward spiral in their relations through quiet diplomacy. With no significant conflict of strategic interest, these two major democracies ought to be close partners. Trudeau can secure India’s cooperation on the murder probe if he is willing to clean up his act at home – in Canada’s own long-term interest.The writer is a geostrategist',\n",
       " \"NEW DELHI: There has been a slow but steady rise in support for both Indian-American presidential candidates- entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley-among the Republican primary voters.In the latest polls for the crucial early primary state of New Hampshire, Ramaswamy and Haley are enjoying more support than Florida governor Ron DeSantis from Republican voters.As per the CNN/University of New Hampshire poll, Trump, who has been indicted four times since April this year and faces 91 criminal charges, remains the top choice of 39 per cent of likely GOP primary voters in this first-in-the-nation primary state.Then, Ramaswamy is in second place with 13 per cent support, followed closely by Haley at 12 per cent and former New Jersey governor Chris Christie at 11 per cent, according to CNN's report. Ron DeSantis has slipped to the 5th position.Ramaswamy's surge in support is primarily centered on individuals who are not affiliated with the Republican Party, showing a remarkable increase of 16 points since July within this demographic, while his backing among registered Republicans has remained relatively stable. Additionally, his popularity has seen substantial growth among younger prospective voters, with a significant 28-point increase among those under the age of 35, and an 11-point rise among those aged 35 to 49. Meanwhile, his support has remained relatively consistent among individuals aged 50 or older.Haley's increase in support is somewhat more pronounced among individuals with higher levels of formal education, showing an 11-point increase among those who have completed some postgraduate work and a 15-point increase among other college graduates. She has also gained 18 points of support among moderates, while her support among conservatives has remained relatively steady since July.Both Ramaswamy and Haley have seen their support grow since the first presidential Republican debate, which was held in Wisconsin last month. The leading Republican contender Trump did not take part in the debate.The second Republican debate is set to take place in California next week. Trump is again set to give a miss to the debate.\",\n",
       " 'I don’t know of a single person who is opposed to the idea, and future reality, of considerably greater representation of women in Parliament, and in all levels of decision making – home, office, divorce etc. The women’s reservation bill is a long overdue act in this march towards justice and equality. The first such bill was introduced in Parliament on September 12, 1996; then others in 1998, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2008 and now.The general expectation is that the bill as tabled in the new Parliament on September 19, 2023 will not be enacted until at least the 2029 election. Why? Because of Clause 5 that states the bill “shall come into effect after an exercise of delimitation is undertaken for this purpose after the relevant figures for the first census taken after commencement of the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Eighth Amendment) Act, 2023 have been published”.That will make it 33 years after the first mooting of the bill – and 2029 maybe a trifle on the optimistic side. Neither the census nor the delimitation exercise is necessary for a ‘theoretical’ passage and enactment in the bill; but Clause 5 makes it so.And there is the 84th Amendment, 2001 that froze constituency boundaries till the first census after 2026, which is expected to take place in 2031. Note that the existing total number of seats in Lok Sabha is based on the 1971 Census. This means that the delimitation exercise is likely to be contentious, at a minimum.Maybe mid-thirties for the implementation of women’s reservation? So the first bill mooted in the Bharat-India Parliament will be implemented more than a decade after being passed? It is often said, in policy-making, that let not the perfect be the enemy of the good. A perfect solution towards the achievement of the very desirable goal of equal representation of women in Parliament would be for every political party to nominate 33% (or 50%) women candidates, and 67% men, for whatever election is taking place – panchayat, municipal, assembly, Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha.This is neither utopian, nor a pipe dream. Indeed, many countries from Rwanda to Sweden have done it. In a PRS list of 12 countries, only three did not have a quota in political parties – Bangladesh, Japan and the US, and only one had a quota in Parliament, Bangladesh.The country with the highest representation of women in Parliament in the world is Rwanda, with 61% parliamentarians after the 2018 election. In 2003, Rwanda enacted a quota law with a difference – the law mandated that 30% of all elected positions will be filled by women. No restriction on how many each political party could select as candidates – zero women, 33%, 50% or even 100%. The law was – let the best person win, and 61% of the electorally best persons were women.In many parts of Europe, women have close to 50% representation in Parliament, and those days are long gone when Indira Gandhi and Golda Meir were the only two women leaders. The new women’s bill has an interesting and informative section titled, ‘Objects and Reasons’, which documents the reasons for the desired necessity of more women parliamentarians:* “True empowerment of women will require greater participation of women in the decision making process.”* “While women participate substantively in the Panchayati Raj institutions and municipal bodies, their representation in the state legislatures as well as in Parliament is still limited. Providing for higher representation of women at State and national level has also been a long pending demand. There have been several efforts to introduce women’s reservation in Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies. The last such attempt was made in 2010, when Rajya Sabha had passed a Bill for women’s reservation, but the same could not be passed in Lok Sabha.”These quotes do not indicate that PM Modi and BJP lawmakers are in a wait and see mood till the mid-2030s. Indeed, one interpretation of Modi’s extraordinary political success (every election, state and central, won with a majority of seats) is that this is because of his “concentration on development and programmes for the poor”. And in his 2016 Independence Day speech, Modi outlined why these policies have to be oriented towards women: “We are working with emphasis on empowerment of women, health of women, economic prosperity of women, physical empowerment of women.”Political empowerment of women is the next logical step. The women’s reservation bill is the first baby step. A giant woman step would be for Modi to announce that for the 2024 election, his party will nominate a large proportion (33%?) of its Lok Sabha candidates as women. Let the woman domino effect come into play.The writer is former Executive Director IMF and former member of PM Modi’s Economic Advisory Council. Views are personal',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday dismissed a petition by real estate company Supertech\\'s chairman and owner RK Arora in a money laundering case.Arora had challenged his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Justice Dinesh Kumar Sharma rejected Arora\\'s claim that he was arrested \"arbitrarily and illegally\" on June 27 without being informed about the grounds of arrest, noting the agency complied with the relevant provisions of law.\"In the present case, the grounds of arrest were duly given and notified to the petitioner and he endorsed the same in writing under his signature. The core issue is of being \\'informed\\' and \\'as soon as\\'. It if has been duly notified and brought to the notice at the time of arrest and further disclosed in detail in the remand application, it amounts to be duly informed and served,\" PTI quoted the court as saying in its order.\"The petition along with pending applications stands dismissed,\" the court said.On June 27, the ED had arrested Arora on money-laundering charges, following a third round of questioning at its office here.The money-laundering case against the Supertech group, its directors and promoters stems from a clutch of FIRs registered by the Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh police.Arora argued before the high court that ED acted in violation of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and his fundamental right under Article 22(1) of the Constitution of India as he was arrested without being informed/communicated/served the grounds of arrest. He claimed he was also denied the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice.The court said there was no violation of the petitioner\\'s fundamental rights and \"there is nothing on the record to suggest that petitioner has been denied the right to consult and be defended by legal practitioner\".\"There is nothing on record to suggest that \\'reason to believe\\' as required under Section 19(1) of the PMLA was not recorded in writing and, therefore, it cannot be held that the petitioner was arrested illegally. The petitioner here failed to show that the arrest of the petitioner is in violation of Section 19 of the PMLA,\" it added.Arora said his arrest has jeopardized the interest of almost 17,000 home buyers as well as a Settlement-cum-Resolution Plan approved by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal which was also given the go-ahead by the Supreme Court.The court said the petitioner cannot be released on interim bail in the present proceedings and \"it would be impractical\" to send him to Mumbai in custody for attending the meetings with the financial creditors.Even for releasing the petitioner on interim bail, the rigors of PMLA have to be satisfied, the court said, adding if he so desires, the jail superintendent may arrange a meeting through video conferencing from the jail itself in accordance with the law.On August 24, the ED had filed a charge sheet against Arora, now in judicial custody, his company, and eight others in a money laundering case, accusing them of hatching a criminal conspiracy to cheat home buyers.They were accused of defrauding at least 670 home buyers of Rs 164 crore.The nearly 100-page prosecution complaint, ED\\'s equivalent of charge sheet, was filed before Special Judge Devender Kumar Jangala, claiming there was sufficient evidence to prosecute Arora for laundering money.The agency informed the trial court that the matter arose from 26 FIRs registered by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh police against Supertech Ltd. and its group companies for alleged criminal conspiracy, cheating, criminal breach of trust and forgery.According to the charge sheet, the company and its directors hatched a \"criminal conspiracy\" to cheat people by collecting funds from prospective home buyers as advance against flats booked in their real estate projects.The company allegedly did not adhere to the agreed obligation of providing possession of the flats on time and \"defrauded\" the general public, the agency said, adding the funds were collected by Supertech Limited and other group companies.The company also took project-specific term loans from banks and financial institutions for the purpose of construction of housing projects, the ED said.However, these funds were \"misappropriated and diverted\" for buying land in the name of other group companies which were pledged as collateral to borrow funds from banks and financial institutions, it added.The Supertech group also defaulted on payments to banks and financial institutions, and currently around Rs 1,500 crore of such loans have become non-performing assets (NPA), the agency said.Supertech Ltd, which was formed in 1988, has so far delivered around 80,000 apartments, mainly in the Delhi-NCR region. The company is currently developing around 25 projects across the National Capital Region (NCR). It is yet to give possession to more than 20,000 customers.The company has been plagued by crisis since last year when in August its nearly 100-meter-tall twin towers - Apex and Ceyane - located on Noida Expressway, were demolished following an order of the Supreme Court which found they were constructed within the Emerald Court premises in violation of norms.Arora had then said the company incurred a loss of about Rs 500 crore, including construction and interest costs, because of the demolition.With PTI inputs',\n",

       " \"NOIDA: To ease traffic congestion in bustling Bengaluru, the Karnataka government has been advised to impose a congestion tax on vehicles entering the city through high-density roads during peak hours.What is congestion tax?Congestion tax is a system of charging vehicles to enter certain areas of a city during peak hours. It is a popular tool to reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. It can also help to strengthen public transportation by encouraging people to switch from private vehicles.Is congestion tax a good idea for Bengaluru?Experts say congestion tax is a good idea for Bengaluru. The city is struggling with severe traffic congestion, and a congestion tax could help to reduce the number of private vehicles on the road. This would make it faster and easier for everyone to get around, and it would also improve air quality.How congestion tax will help Bengaluru?BMTC officials believe that a congestion tax in high-density corridors would discourage private vehicles and encourage public transport, as it would make driving more expensive and public transport more attractive.How Bengaluru is planning to collect congestion tax?FASTag, which has been successfully implemented here since 2021, could be used to collect congestion tax for ease and convenience. Toll machines would be placed at major access points to busy areas, and vehicles would be photographed with cameras as they cross the toll points. The congestion tax would then be automatically deducted from the vehicle owner's bank account.Has congestion tax system been implemented in any other Indian city?No. Similar proposals for congestion taxes in New Delhi and Mumbai failed in the past, largely due to political opposition and lobbying from the private car industry.What are the high-density corridors in Bengaluru?The high-density corridors in the city include Outer Ring Road, Sarjapur Road, Hosur Road, Old Airport Road, Old Madras Road, Ballari Road, Bannerghatta Road, Kanakapura Road, Magadi Road, West of Chord Road and Tumakuru Road.Which major world cities have congestion tax system?Singapore, London, and Stockholm are all examples of cities that have successfully implemented congestion pricing.Singapore: Singapore's congestion pricing system is fully automated and uses variable charges depending on the time of day and the specific area of the city.London: In London, vehicles entering central London during business hours on weekdays have to pay a charge.Stockholm: In Stockholm, there is a tax on vehicles entering the city on weekdays during the day.\",\n",

According to sources, the new routes are Jaipur-Udaipur, Patna-Howrah, Ranchi-Howrah, Hyderabad-Chennai, Chennai-Tirunelveli, Indore-Jaipur, Puri-Rourkela, Jaipur-Chandigarh and Jamnagar-Ahmedabad.The Railways also conducted a successful trial run of the Vande Bharat Express train from Hyderabad to Bengaluru, covering a distance of 610 km in 7.5 hours. The Tirunelveli–Chennai Vande Bharat Express will also be flagged off on Sunday. The train is likely to be flagged off, with stops at Virudhunagar, Madurai, Dindigul, Trichy, and Villupuram. Another train will run on the Vijayawada-Chennai route via Renigunta, catering to passengers going to Tirupati.

       " 'Delhi Transport Minister, Kailash Gahlot, in a recent statement has suggested that the government is looking to incentivise those, who want to retrofit their old petrol/diesel cars with EV conversion kits in the capital city. The minister also confirmed that while the existing EV policy is being extended for six months, a new policy is in the works and that an EV conversion incentive could be a part of that. While converting an old car into an electric vehicle may sound like a better alternative than buying a brand new EV, it is not cheap and the costs can run up into lakhs of rupees. Here’s what converting an old petrol-diesel car into electric takes. According to a PTI report, minister Gahlot told the agency, “People want to convert their ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) cars into electric vehicles. The process is expensive. For converting a normal Gypsy, it takes almost Rs 5 to 6 lakh, which is on the higher side. We will look at how to incentivise it.” The minister is certainly not wrong, converting an ICE car into an EV takes lot of work, modifications and investment. What does it take to do an EV retrofit?Retrofitting an old petrol or diesel car with an EV kit, means that the vehicle first needs to be shed of its internal combustion engine and other related systems before an electric drivetrain can be retrofitted within the existing structural parameters of the old vehicle. Authorised workshops first have to completely disassemble the vehicle including the engine, fuel lines, fuel tank, filters, AC unit and a lot more.In the end, the vehicle’s chassis, cabin, wheels, brakes are left and trained technicians can start retrofitting an electric conversion kit which includes the motor, a controller to run that motor, all-new and heavier wiring harness and the battery pack along with battery management system and more. The conversion process is simply not a plug-and-play affair and takes a considerable amount of labour, engineering and money. Why is it costly?The main cost in an electric conversion kit is for the battery that will run the retrofit EV. On an average, 1kWh of lithium-ion battery costs up to Rs 14,000. If the person getting a retrofit is looking to get 250 km to 300 km of range from the vehicle, then they need to get a battery pack of 25 kWh to 35 kWh capacity. This would set them back approximately Rs 3.5 lakh in battery cost alone. The electric motor, motor controller, BMS and other peripherals add Rs 2.5 to 3 lakh cost over the battery cost. It adds even further if you are looking to add convenience features such as an AC unit, which comes at an additional Rs 1 lakh on average and labour cost has not been accounted for up till now. Does it make sense?While a retrofitted vehicle can continue to be driven for years to come, one has to consider the big investment they will be making on a car which is already 10 year or 15 year old and nearing its end-of life in terms of components. In a statement shared with TOI Auto in 2022, India’s first ARAI certified retrofitter, ETrio, had said, “ “The important considerations before going for retrofitment (ICE to EV conversion) are the age of the vehicle, useful remaining life of the vehicle and the ability to get finance for the retrofitment. The cost varies depending on the type of kit, range etc. For a typical small car, the cost would be approximately Rs 3 to 4 lakhs for the kit. Buying a new EV car is always better from the customers’ perspective, especially in terms of warranties, reliability and the ability to get financing. On the other hand, retrofitment makes more economical sense for the commercial vehicle segment, as it plays a pivotal role in adding a new lease of life and performance to cargo vehicles used for logistics particularly.While converting an old car into an EV is not cheap, it remains to be seen what kind of incentives the government proposes in the Delhi EV Policy 2.0, if it does. Considering the high cost of battery, motor, labour and more, would you convert your old car or buy a new EV? Let us know in the comments.',\n",
       " 'KYIV: Ukraine carried out a fiery missile strike on Friday on the main headquarters of Russia\\'s Black Sea Fleet, a Russian official said. Videos and photos showed large plumes of smoke over the building in Sevastopol in annexed Crimea. The Russian-installed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said there was no information about casualties. He said firefighters were battling a blaze, and more emergency forces were being brought in, an indication that the fire could be massive. A stream of ambulances were arriving at the fleet\\'s headquarters and shrapnel was scattered hundreds of metres (yards) around, the Tass news agency reported. Razvozhayev initially warned Sevastopol residents that another attack was possible and urged them not to leave buildings or go to the city centre. He later said there was no longer any air strike danger but reiterated calls not to go to the central part of the city, saying roads were closed and and unspecified \"special efforts\" were underway. Ukrainian officials, who have claimed responsibility for a series of other recent attacks on Crimea, didn\\'t immediately announce Kyiv launched the strike. Sevastopol residents said they heard explosions in the skies and saw smoke, Russian news outlets reported. Images circulated in Ukrainian Telegram channels showed clouds of smoke over the seafront. The Associated Press could not immediately verify the videos. The attack comes a day after Russian missiles and artillery pounded cities across Ukraine, killing at least five people as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President Joe Biden and congressional leaders in Washington with an additional USD 24 billion aid package being considered. The port city of Sevastopol serves as the main base for Russia\\'s Black Sea Fleet. Last week, the Russian-installed authorities there accused Ukraine of attacking a strategic shipyard in the city, damaging two ships undergoing repairs and causing a fire at the facility. The Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in an act that most of the world considered illegal, has been a frequent target since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than 18 months ago. The attack on the shipyard was the biggest in weeks. In other developments, ongoing shelling in the southern Kherson region killed one man and injured another, said regional Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin. \"Kherson has been restless since the morning,\" he said on Telegram. Russian shelling sparked fires in a residential building and a garage. In Kharkiv, regional Gov. Oleh Synyehubov said over 14 settlements came under attack. A house was damaged and a fire broke out in Vovchansk, in Chuguyiv district. There were no casualties, the governor said.',\n",

       " \"Indian higher education institutions are struggling to meet the expectations of the contemporary challenges and need for modern skills with a curriculum that was revamped almost four decades ago. The curriculum is the backbone of an education system, which requires regular tunings with the evolving socio-economic and other factors. India, which surpassed China as the most populous country in April 2023, is a human resource-intensive country and needs a skilled workforce to power up the economy. According to a research paper published in ResearchGate on “Curriculum Reforms in Higher Education of India for Employability, Entrepreneurship and Skill Development,” essential steps to reform Indian Higher Education Institutions are:Planning and restructuring the curriculum to ensure effective learning and teaching to improve the overall standards of educationEquipping students with practical and technical skills in the field of their interest. Skilling should begin at an early age and continue in higher education.Drafting a job-oriented curriculum to fulfill the needs and aspirations of the studentsImproving employability and encouraging entrepreneurship with internships, vocational training, boot camps, workshops, and moreUpskilling teaching faculty with workshops and training to make them tech-aware and hire tech-savvy new facultySeminars, trainings and workshops to exchange ideas, discourse on effective teaching methods and moreIn a welcome move to improve the higher education system and institutions, the Ministry of HRD launched the National Education Policy on 30 July 2020. It will come into effect from the current academic year 2023-24. NEP will be a game-changer in the Indian education system with the motto “Educate, Encourage, Enlighten.” It will replace the National Policy on Education 1986, launched by Shri Rajiv Gandhi. Key highlights of NEP 2020 for higher education:GER in higher education to be raised to 50% by 2035, and 3.5 crore seats to be added in higher education Flexibility of subjects in higher education curriculum Multiple entries and exits with appropriate certification An Academic Bank of Credits is to be established to facilitate the Transfer of Credits. National Research Foundation to be established to foster a strong research culture Affiliation system to be phased out in 15 years with graded autonomy to colleges National Educational Technology Forum to be created for higher use of technology with equity Special Education Zones, Gender Inclusion Funds and other initiatives for disadvantaged regions and groups National Institute of Pali, Persian, and Prakrit, Indian Institute of Translation and Interpretation to be set up for promoting multilingualism at schools and higher education institutions In an exclusive chat with Prof. (Dr.) G.K. Prabhu, President, Manipal University Jaipur (MUJ), spoke about reforms MUJ plans to make in the curriculum for the academic session 2023-24. He said, “We keep hearing that students passing out of higher education institutions are not employable. Around 75% of engineers are considered unemployable. The reasons behind this might be that we teach something which is not relevant.” “We at Manipal University Jaipur and Manipal Group of Universities would like to bring relevance in the curriculum that prepares students with future skills that ensure readiness for the job market not only at present but after four years when they will graduate.” He continued, “We are using National Education Policy to make our vision a reality to make the curriculum competent, relevant and flexible. He also wants to integrate the fun factor into the education system by adding an experiential part to learning. However, fun should be responsible for a holistic growth and successful future.” National Education Policy 2020 is a welcome step towards fulfilling the need for a curriculum revamp for the higher education system and institutions. These reforms will prepare students with future skills for challenges in the tech era. In addition to the reforms proposed in NEP and recommendations in the paper published in ResearchGate, the Government of India can implement certain things to enhance the effectiveness of the curriculum at Indian higher education institutions. These include: ● Giving more autonomy to universities to enhance their curriculum, upskill existing faculty and hire new faculty with their standards ● Supporting universities to create advanced research facilities and encourage innovations ● Making higher education affordable and accessible for students from all backgrounds ● Focus on higher education institutions in Tier II, Tier III and rural areas. India needs massive curriculum reforms, and these steps will prepare students with future skills and improve employability. It’s time to reclaim the much-deserving ‘Vishwa Guru’ title. Let’s conclude with a quote from the farewell speech of Ex-President Ram Nath Kovind, “The 21st Century will be India’s, and the National Education Policy lays down the path for the same along with health and economic sector reforms.”Disclaimer: The article has been produced on behalf of Manipal University Jaipur by the Times Internet's Spotlight team.\",\n",

       " 'LUCKNOW: BJP MP Varun Gandhi on Friday said that the Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to suspend the operational license of Sanjay Gandhi hospital in Amethi will have far-reaching implications for the region’s health care access, employment and education.Varun wrote to deputy CM Brajesh Pathak requesting him to reconsider the suspension decision, initiate an impartial inquiry and ensure that the hospital continues to provide critical healthcare services to the people of UP. The foundation stone of the hospital, named after Varun’s father Sanjay Gandhi, was laid by his grandmother and former PM Indira Gandhi in 1982.On September 18, the state government issued an order to seal the hospital, four days after a woman died in hospital after she was administered anesthesia before surgery. Pathak had then said that the decision to suspend the licenses of the hospital was taken after a local inquiry. “We would not spare any hospital that knowingly pushed a patient into the mouth of death,” Pathak had said.Subsequently, on September 21, the employees’ union of the hospital wrote to governor Anandi Ben Patel, chief minister Yogi Adityantah, and the district administration, drawing their attention to the fact that sudden closure of the hospital may lead to a crisis vis-à-vis day-to-day necessities.Varun said that the suspension of the hospital’s license will create a “significant void” in the region’s health care landscape, profoundly impacting our citizen’s well-being.The BBJP’s Pilibhit MP said that the hospital also served as a significant employer with around 450 dedicated staff members and thousands of others whose livelihood depend on the continuous operation of this institute. “The suspension not only jeopardises health care access but also places the livelihood of the individual and their families in jeopardy,” he said. Varun also pointed out that the hospital also played a commendable role in healthcare education by training 600 nurning and 200 paramedic students every year.“Suspending the hospital unilaterally, without affording it any opportunity to explain, raises concern…,” he said.',\n",

       " 'Amid the ongoing diplomatic row with India over the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a new opinion poll has got more worrying news for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.According to a new Ipsos poll conducted for the Canada-based news platform Global News, Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, has emerged as the preferred choice for Prime Minister among 40 percent of Canadian citizens. In contrast, PM Justin Trudeau lags behind with only 31 percent support.According to a Global News report, Ipsos CEO Darrell Bricker noted that the gap between Poilievre and Trudeau in leadership preferences indicates that the Conservatives could secure a majority government if an election were held today. Dissatisfaction with the country\\'s direction, particularly concerning economic concerns, such as the cost of living, access to housing, and inflation, has contributed to this sentiment.Pierre Poilievre\\'s popularity as the Conservative Leader has been steadily increasing, with 40 percent of Canadians now considering him the best choice for Prime Minister. This represents a five-point increase in his favorability ratings compared to the previous year. In contrast, Justin Trudeau\\'s support as the preferred Prime Minister has remained static at 31 percent. Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the NDP (New Democratic Party), who is known for his sympathies towards Khalistan and his coalition partnership with Prime Minister Trudeau, has experienced a four-point decline since September 2022. Currently, only 22 percent of respondents view him as the best choice to lead the government.The poll also delved into core issues affecting Canada, including the economy, healthcare, and housing. It revealed that a plurality of Canadians believe that Pierre Poilievre has the most compelling plans in all three of these areas.Time for Trudeau to step aside?While Justin Trudeau has reiterated his intention to lead the Liberal Party into the upcoming election, a majority of respondents do not view this as a favorable course of action.The Ipsos survey findings indicate that 60 percent of Canadians believe it\\'s time for Trudeau to step down as the leader, allowing someone else to take the reins of the Liberals in the forthcoming election. This marks an increase from the 54 percent recorded in a December 2022 poll. Poilievre demands more proof on Canada allegationsTensions flared between India and Canada early this week following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\\'s explosive allegations of the \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on his country\\'s soil on June 18 in British Columbia.

The building also houses the ASP’s office and is located between Moudhapara and Gol Bazar police stations.Sikandar allegedly forced himself on her in the guard room in the basement parking area, and told her to return the next day for “detailed discussions” if she wanted to get a job.Police say this was a trap to gangrape her. When she returned on September 19 for what she believed was a job interview, she found two other men with Sikandar, who he introduced as his friends Avinash Behra, 35, and Gaurav Raj, 32.Avinash and Gaurav took her to a parked car in the basement on the pretext of showing her some documents but gangraped her. She tried to fight back but was overpowered. They threatened to kill her if she complained to anyone, she told police.Once back home, she confided in her parents, who immediately took her to the police, who registered a case under Pocso Act. The three accused were arrested within hours. Preliminary investigation has found that the three had hatched a conspiracy to rape her.While Sikandar works as a security guard, Gaurav is a bank employee and Avinash is a contractor.

Among these nine trains, two Vande Bharat trains will be launched for West Bengal. \"Of the two Vande Bharat trains, one is coming from Patna to Howrah, mostly will cover Bengal from the Chittaranjan area to Howrah and another train from Ranchi is coming to Howrah. Both trains will be inaugurated on September 24 and will reach Howrah station at about 10 pm,\" CPRO Eastern Railway Kaushik Mitra said. Apart from Bengal, Indore will get another Vande Bharat Express, this time to Jaipur.At present, Indore has only one Vande Bharat — to Bhopal — but it is struggling to fill up seats because travelers have plenty of other travel options between the two cities. Bhopal, on the other hand, has Vande trains to Gwalior, Jabalpur and New Delhi as well. There are 25 Vande Bharat Expresses in the country, and the count will rise to 34 in a few days.

       " \"Brampton, Ontario-based Punjabi rapper Shubhneet Singh a.k.a Shubh is 26 years old. He has 13.1 million monthly listeners on Spotify, 3.25M subscribers on YouTube, and 1.1 million followers on Instagram. Not too long back, his followers included Virat Kohli and cricketers like Hardik Pandya KL Rahul.According to a Wikipedia page that has sprung up, his Still Rollin world tour was to include Bengaluru, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Ludhiana, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Mumbai, Kolkata and Pune.But all that is in the past tense now, because of a six-month-old Instagram post that Shubh had later deleted.In March this year, Shubh had shot into the limelight in India when he had posted an Instagram story that showed an illustration of a police officer unplugging an illuminated India map.The map had Jammu Kashmir, Ladakh and the Northeast states missing, and Punjab was blackened. As caption to the post, Shubh had written: Pray for Punjab.It caused a furore online, with many including Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut calling out the Indo-Canadian rapper.Shubh had later deleted the post, and posted an image with only the caption, Pray for Punjab.This was at the time the Punjab police had launched a massive manhunt for separatist preacher Amritpal Singh.But Shubh’s post resurfaced to haunt him, and one main reason was that the ties between India and Canada hit their lowest point in decades after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau dropped this bombshell in his country’s Parliament. That too, shortly after visiting New Delhi for the G-20 Summit: “Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing a potential link between agents of the Government of India and the killing of a Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar…”What has followed since then has become a full-blown diplomatic spat, with both India and Canada expelling a diplomat each from the other country. India has also issued a travel advisory for Canada.In the heat and dust of this tension with Canada, Shubhneet Singh was to perform in India.As it usually happens in such situations, an organisation approached Mumbai police, pointing to the Indo-Canadian rappers Instagram post. What followed was a swift domino effect.On September 19, gadget brand BOAT withdrew sponsorship of the rapper’s tour. The company said on social media: “At BOAT, while our commitment upgrade to the incredible music community runs deep, we are first and foremost a true Indian brand. Therefore, when we became aware of the remarks by artist Shubh earlier this year, we chose to withdraw our sponsorship for the tour….”A day later, Book My Show, which was the ticketing agent for Shubhneet Singh’s shows, posted on social media: Singer Shubhneet Singh’s Still Rollin Tour for India stands cancelled. To that end, BookMyShow has initiated a complete refund of the ticket amount for all consumers who had purchased tickets for the show. The refund will be reflected within 7-10 working days in the customer's source account of the original transaction.The repercussions have not ended for Shubhneet Singh a.k.a Shubh, with reports of music apps pulling down his tunes coming in fast.Incidentally, India’s pointing to Canada harbouring Khalistani agents is not new. Do remember that the bombing of the Air India flight Kanishka in 1985 was the deadliest act of aviation terrorism till 9/11.Anchor: Srirupa RayAudio production: Sahil Gupta\",\n",
       " 'Delhi Transport Minister, Kailash Gahlot, in a recent statement has suggested that the government is looking to incentivise those, who want to retrofit their old petrol/diesel cars with EV conversion kits in the capital city. The minister also confirmed that while the existing EV policy is being extended for six months, a new policy is in the works and that an EV conversion incentive could be a part of that. While converting an old car into an electric vehicle may sound like a better alternative than buying a brand new EV, it is not cheap and the costs can run up into lakhs of rupees. Here’s what converting an old petrol-diesel car into electric takes. According to a PTI report, minister Gahlot told the agency, “People want to convert their ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) cars into electric vehicles. The process is expensive. For converting a normal Gypsy, it takes almost Rs 5 to 6 lakh, which is on the higher side. We will look at how to incentivise it.” The minister is certainly not wrong, converting an ICE car into an EV takes lot of work, modifications and investment. What does it take to do an EV retrofit?Retrofitting an old petrol or diesel car with an EV kit, means that the vehicle first needs to be shed of its internal combustion engine and other related systems before an electric drivetrain can be retrofitted within the existing structural parameters of the old vehicle. Authorised workshops first have to completely disassemble the vehicle including the engine, fuel lines, fuel tank, filters, AC unit and a lot more.In the end, the vehicle’s chassis, cabin, wheels, brakes are left and trained technicians can start retrofitting an electric conversion kit which includes the motor, a controller to run that motor, all-new and heavier wiring harness and the battery pack along with battery management system and more. The conversion process is simply not a plug-and-play affair and takes a considerable amount of labour, engineering and money. Why is it costly?The main cost in an electric conversion kit is for the battery that will run the retrofit EV. On an average, 1kWh of lithium-ion battery costs up to Rs 14,000. If the person getting a retrofit is looking to get 250 km to 300 km of range from the vehicle, then they need to get a battery pack of 25 kWh to 35 kWh capacity. This would set them back approximately Rs 3.5 lakh in battery cost alone. The electric motor, motor controller, BMS and other peripherals add Rs 2.5 to 3 lakh cost over the battery cost. It adds even further if you are looking to add convenience features such as an AC unit, which comes at an additional Rs 1 lakh on average and labour cost has not been accounted for up till now. Does it make sense?While a retrofitted vehicle can continue to be driven for years to come, one has to consider the big investment they will be making on a car which is already 10 year or 15 year old and nearing its end-of life in terms of components. In a statement shared with TOI Auto in 2022, India’s first ARAI certified retrofitter, ETrio, had said, “ “The important considerations before going for retrofitment (ICE to EV conversion) are the age of the vehicle, useful remaining life of the vehicle and the ability to get finance for the retrofitment. The cost varies depending on the type of kit, range etc. For a typical small car, the cost would be approximately Rs 3 to 4 lakhs for the kit. Buying a new EV car is always better from the customers’ perspective, especially in terms of warranties, reliability and the ability to get financing. On the other hand, retrofitment makes more economical sense for the commercial vehicle segment, as it plays a pivotal role in adding a new lease of life and performance to cargo vehicles used for logistics particularly.While converting an old car into an EV is not cheap, it remains to be seen what kind of incentives the government proposes in the Delhi EV Policy 2.0, if it does. Considering the high cost of battery, motor, labour and more, would you convert your old car or buy a new EV? Let us know in the comments.',\n",

China didn\\'t refuse any visa. Unfortunately, these athletes didn\\'t accept this visa. I don\\'t think this is OCA problem because China has an agreement to let all the athletes who have certified eligibility come to compete in China. This is clear. The visa has already been granted,\" said Wei.The OCA\\'s acting president Randhir Singh said: \"We had a meeting on Thursday with the Working Group and this has been taken up. They are taking it up with the government and we are also taking it up with the government.\"Discrimination based on domicile: MEAThe development comes as the Ministry of External Affairs reacted to reports of discrimination by Chinese authorities.\"The government of India has learnt that the Chinese authorities have, in a targeted and pre-meditated manner, discriminated against some Indian sportspersons from the state of Arunachal Pradesh by denying them accreditation and entry to the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, China,\" said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.\"In line with our long-standing and consistent position, India firmly rejects differential treatment of Indian citizens based on domicile or ethnicity. Arunachal Pradesh was, is and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India. A strong protest has been lodged in New Delhi and Beijing against China\\'s deliberate and selective obstruction of some of our sportspersons,\" he added. The MEA said that China’s action violates both the spirit of the Asian Games and the rules governing their conduct, which explicitly prohibits discrimination against competitors from member states. \"As a mark of our protest against the Chinese action, the Union sports minister has cancelled his scheduled visit to China for the Games. The government of India reserves the right to take suitable measures to safeguard our interests,\" added Bagchi.Martial arts athletesSeveral media reports stated that three Indian martial arts athletes from Arunachal Pradesh have been forced to pull out of the Asian Games after not receiving clearance from the host country.The three women are wushu fighters. Wushu, or kung fu, is a multi-disciplinary martial art originating in China. The trio was approved to take part by the Hangzhou Asian Games Organising Committee but were unable to download their accreditation cards -- which act as visas to enter China. The rest of the 10-member squad along with the coaching staff left for the Games in Hangzhou on Wednesday. Past incidentThe Indian wushu team did not travel to the Chinese city of Chengdu for the World University Games in July this year after the same three athletes were issued stapled, rather than pasted, visas -- an indication that Beijing does not recognise India\\'s territorial claim over Arunachal Pradesh, said some media reports.The move triggered angry reactions from the Indian side with the foreign ministry saying it was \"unacceptable\".(With inputs from agencies)',\n",

       " 'Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged there was a potential link between Indian and the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Khalistani separatist leader, at British Columbia in June. The startling accusation was followed by the Canadian foreign minister stating that their government had expelled a high-ranking Indian diplomat over the killing. India rejected Canada’s claim over the killing calling it absurd, and gave the north American country a taste of its own medicine by expelling a top Canadian diplomat in India.Canada provoked India with a fresh set of travel advisory asking its citizens to exercise high degree of caution. India again responded asking Indian nationals and students in Canada to exercise extreme caution due to deteriorating security scenario.Earlier at the G20 summit, Trudeau and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a tense meeting and Modi accused Canada of not doing enough to quell anti-India activities of extremist elements, referring to the rise of the Sikh separatist movement on Canadian soil.Nijjar was involved in several terrorist activities and targeted killings in Punjab. He was associated with Gurudwara politics in Canada that were often violent. He had links with gangster Arshdeep Singh. Nijjar was also friendly with Dal Khalsa leader Gajinder Singh, one of the five hijackers of an Indian Airlines flight in 1981. Gajinder Singh is currently in Pakistan. Last year, India’s National Investigation Agency had declared a cash reward of Rs 10 lakh for Nijjar.How will the worsening diplomatic relations impact Indians on work permit in Canada?Most students who go from India after their completing studies, especially from Punjab, get work permits for extended stay. During this time, they have to ensure sponsorship from their employers. At present, they are worried that if ties between the two countries worsen, they may not get sponsorship and work permit. They may have to leave Canada.The students also face the fear of being labeled anti-Canada. They may be targeted for “creating trouble”. It has added to their anxiety.Indian applicants queued up for permanent residence in Canada, also must be apprehensive that their cases may get delayed.India and Canada have had a love-hate relationship for over 100 years. Is the standoff likely to end amicably?That incident occurred way back in 1914 when the Komagata Maru ship carrying 376 Indian citizens, all from Punjab, were not allowed to disembark at Vancouver. Only 30 were allowed to stay, rest were sent back because of stringent Canadian immigration laws. The ship was returned to Calcutta.The police in India arrested some leaders of that ship, led by Gurdit Singh Sandhu. Later he was known as Gurdit Singh Komagata Maru. It led to a scuffle, and subsequently a riot in which police fired at the Indian passengers. Over 20 were killed.It took Canada 109 years to apologise for that. The Canadian Parliament apologised in 2016, when Justin Trudeau was the Prime Minister.But that incident cannot be compared with today’s situation. It happened a long time back. At that time, it was about Indian immigrants. Now, it’s about a Canadian citizen who was wanted for terror crimes in India.Thirty per cent of all the Sikhs in Canada are Canadian citizens by birth. Why is the number so high?The first recorded incident of a Sikh landing in Canada was 1897. British soldier Resaldar Major Kesar Singh went there and subsequently, by 1902, a few more reached British Columbia. They took up jobs in mining and lumberjacking. Ultimately, they became prosperous because they got good money for their hard labour. Then they made Canada their place of residence. Many of them were told to leave Canada because of the then Canadian immigration laws, but ultimately the community started growing there. In the 1950s, the shift started from British Columbia towards Ontario. In the 1960s and 70s, more immigrants started going to Ontario, and many of them were well educated professionals — doctors, engineers and lawyers. Another thrust came in the 1990s, when a lot of professionals from Punjab migrated for want of better opportunities in Punjab due to the peak of militancy. The trend continues till today. What was the reason for the 2017 diplomatic standoff between then Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and Canadian defence minister Harjit Singh Sajjan?When Sajjan visited India in 2017, Captain Amarinder Singh refused to meet him alleging that he was a Khalistan supporter. He said that Sajjan’s father, Sundar Singh, was a member of the World Sikh Organization which was involved in alleged anti-India or pro-Khalistan activities.When Trudeau came to India in 2018, he wanted to visit Amritsar. He placed a request, but the Ministry of External Affairs told him to take it up with Captain Amarinder Singh. The then chief minister was unhappy that a list of 10 designated terrorists had been given to Canada, yet the Canadian government had not acted.Later, the tension was diffused, and they met at a hotel in Amritsar where Singh conveyed his fears and apprehensions to Trudeau.Audio production: Prateek Kapoor',\n",
       " 'LUCKNOW: BJP MP Varun Gandhi on Friday said that the Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to suspend the operational license of Sanjay Gandhi hospital in Amethi will have far-reaching implications for the region’s health care access, employment and education.Varun wrote to deputy CM Brajesh Pathak requesting him to reconsider the suspension decision, initiate an impartial inquiry and ensure that the hospital continues to provide critical healthcare services to the people of UP. The foundation stone of the hospital, named after Varun’s father Sanjay Gandhi, was laid by his grandmother and former PM Indira Gandhi in 1982.On September 18, the state government issued an order to seal the hospital, four days after a woman died in hospital after she was administered anesthesia before surgery. Pathak had then said that the decision to suspend the licenses of the hospital was taken after a local inquiry. “We would not spare any hospital that knowingly pushed a patient into the mouth of death,” Pathak had said.Subsequently, on September 21, the employees’ union of the hospital wrote to governor Anandi Ben Patel, chief minister Yogi Adityantah, and the district administration, drawing their attention to the fact that sudden closure of the hospital may lead to a crisis vis-à-vis day-to-day necessities.Varun said that the suspension of the hospital’s license will create a “significant void” in the region’s health care landscape, profoundly impacting our citizen’s well-being.The BBJP’s Pilibhit MP said that the hospital also served as a significant employer with around 450 dedicated staff members and thousands of others whose livelihood depend on the continuous operation of this institute. “The suspension not only jeopardises health care access but also places the livelihood of the individual and their families in jeopardy,” he said. Varun also pointed out that the hospital also played a commendable role in healthcare education by training 600 nurning and 200 paramedic students every year.“Suspending the hospital unilaterally, without affording it any opportunity to explain, raises concern…,” he said.',\n",

As of now, no signals have been received from them. Efforts to establish contact will continue,\" Isro said late Friday.More than a fortnight ago, when it uplinked the commands to put Vikram and Pragyan in sleep mode, the space agency said it hoped for their waking up on September 22.Isro chairman S Somanath had told TOI when Vikram and Pragyan went to sleep: “The lander and rover should awake automatically, we’ve kept some circuits alive for this.

       " \"NEW DELHI: Two members of Salman Tyagi gang were arrested for allegedly firing outside two shops for extorting money from the owners in west Delhi's Subhash Nagar area, police said on Friday. The accused have been identified as Deepanshu (21), a resident of Vishnu Garden, and Moinuddin alias Salman (21), a resident of Tihar Village, they said. On the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, two firing incidents took place in the Rajouri Garden area, police said. In the first incident, Deepanshu and Moinuddin came to a restaurant in Subash Nagar on a scooter and fired two rounds on the flex board of the restaurant. Five minutes later, they reached another shop and fired three rounds there, they said. It was found that the firing incidents took place over extortion demand of Rs 50 lakhs each from the owners of the shops, they said. During the investigation, over 200 CCTV cameras were checked and analysed. Police got a tip-off that the accused persons would come near Mayapuri Metro Station to meet someone, Special Commissioner of Police (Crime) Ravindra Singh Yadav said. A trap was laid and Moinuddin was apprehended. Later, Deepanshu, who was the pillion rider and had fired the bullets, was also nabbed near Pacific Mall, Subhash Nagar, Yadav said. Deepanshu disclosed that he is a close associate of Salman Tyagi, who is currently lodged in Mandoli Jail. He keeps meeting Tygai in jail, police said. During one of his visits last week, Tyagi arranged weapons and instructed him to make an extortion demand of Rs 50 lakh from each businessman, police said At the behest of Tyagi, both the accused opened fire in front of the victims' shops, they said. Tyagi is lodged in Mandoli Jail in several cases of murder and extortion. Over 25 heinous cases are registered against him, police said. He and his associates killed a businessman Ajay Choudhary of Keshopur Mandi. It is believed that Tyagi has recently switched sides and joined hands with Naresh Sethi-Kala Jathedi-Lawrence Binshnoi gang. He was earlier a close associate of gangster Neeraj Bawania, police said. Moinuddin was in touch with Tyagi through social media and had supplied arms and money to the gang members on his instructions several times, they said.(With PTI inputs)\",\n",
       " 'MUMBAI: A special NIA trial court denying bail to dismissed police officer Sachin Waze has held that though the gelatin sticks planted in a vehicle parked in February 2021 near Antilia in south Mumbai were not connected to a detonator, it was sufficient to cause terror in the minds of people.\"Here in this case the attempt of the applicant (Waze) was to create terror in the mind of particular section of people and that is the Ambani Family\", said special Judge A M Patil and therefore Waze’s plea that sans detonator no terror could be caused, is devoid of merit.The court in its detailed reasoned order of September 16, made available now referred to witnesses and documents on record, to say that Waze and other co-accused tried to spread terror in the mind of Ambani family and when businessman Mansukh Hiran’s whose vehicle was allegedly used, denied to accept the February 25, 2021 act as his crime, they \"eliminated Mansukh by conspiring with each other. It was well planned murder.\" The court said every precaution was taken to escape the clutches of law.If released there is every possibility of Waze tampering with witnesses held by the court.Waze’s counsel Sajal Yadav had argued that the ex-cop was falsely implicated due to inter departmental rivalry, questioned the prosecution sanction and argued lack of evidence to show Waze had planted any explosives in the vehicle. The court said the sanction cannot be said to be improper at this stage and held that Waze was silent on details of the alleged internal rivalry.Yadav said no terror case under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) was made out against Waze and said there was no extortion call made to the industrialist and nor were his or family’s statement recorded.The motive alleged against the then assistant police inspector was only to \"regain his clout\" said Yadav and also argued that in the recent past when the Reliance hospital and BKC school received a bomb threat, anti-terror law provisions were not invoked.Special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves for National Investigation Agency (NIA) opposing Waze’s plea said the chargesheet makes his involvement in the crimes, to commit a \"terrorist act\" and the \"cold blooded murder\" of Hiran, \"crystal clear\".To regain clout was “not the only motive behind the crime’’ said the court. It added that witness statements show that Waze “tried to spread terror… to extort money’’ and used and placed the explosive laden Scorpio near Antilia. Waze was reinstated in the Mumbai police force in June 2020, after a long suspension and had an office in the police commissioner’s office compound said a key-witness, the court noted adding that Hiran’s son said the Scorpio in which explosives were laden was sold in November 2020 by his father to Waze and returned back next February first week on the grounds that he did not like it.The court said Waze’s bail plea makes no mention of him having the vehicle for over two months. On February 18, 2021, Hiran had lodged a theft report with the Vikhroli police of his Scorpio which he parked by the highway the previous day. Waze said that the theft case is not closed. The NIA said Hiran handed over the Scorpio keys on February 17 night to Waze.The court citing witness statements said Waze, mid February 2021, pursuant to a conspiracy “extorted huge cash amounts from bar owners.” The alleged murder of Hiran was on March 4, 2021.There are a total of 10 accused. “ Matter is serious,’’ said the special court, adding, “Many of the accused are still striving for bail. If all the accused and their advocates co-operate then the delay in trial can be avoided.’’ But mere ground of delay is insufficient to grant Waze bail, the order said.The order said a witness mentions that on March 5, 2021, police inspector Sunil Mane and co-accused met Waze , both then met the then Mumbai police chief in his office and came back at 3 pm for lunch. “In the statement of Vimala Hiran, it establishes the relevant motive and intention of applicant (Waze) and his co-accused in furtherance of larger conspiracy and commission of crime of murder of Mansukh Hiran, since Mansukh Hiran was not ready to take the blame of crime dated 25.02.2021 on his own. The applicant and co-accused hatched conspiracy and eliminated Mansukh Hiran.’’The reasoned 43-page order said, “Prima-facie, statements of protected witnesses corroborated about the presence of Sunil Mane in the office of applicant along with Mansukh Hiran and hatching of conspiracy by the applicant, Sunil Mane, Pradeep Sharma and others at the CP office compound, Andheri (East) and at other places in Mumbai. There is sufficient evidence on record which revealed that applicant had called Mansukh Hiran to his office from 27.02.2021 till 03.03.2021 so as to persuade Mansukh Hiran to take blame of the incident dated 25.02.2021’’ and added, “ It is also established that SIM card used by Sunil Mane in the murder of Mansukh Hiran was given to him by the applicant and which was given to the applicant by Vinayak Shinde through Naresh Gaur and further to Sunil Mane at the instance of Pradeep Sharma. There is ample of evidence to show that applicant and Mansukh Hiran had planned to alleged theft of said green colour Scorpio vehicle at the instance of the applicant on or prior to 17.02.2021 and applicant had full control and possession over the said Scorpio prior to 05.02.2021… It is also established that applicant along with his associates took the physical possession of the said Scorpio and kept the vehicle opposite Shikhar Kunj Building after planting of explosives near Antilia along with threat note.’’',\n",

The injured DRG constable, identified as Sannu Hemla, suffered shrapnel wounds while participating in an anti-Maoist operation when he inadvertently triggered a pressure-activated IED. It is a common tactic employed by the rebels to target security forces.According to the Bijapur Police, the incident unfolded in the forested vicinity near Durdha village at around 1pm, while a DRG team was returning from their operation.The injured constable was evacuated to the district hospital in Bijapur, where his condition is reported as stable, as confirmed by the police.A search operation is presently underway in the area, police said.',\n",
       " \"Brampton, Ontario-based Punjabi rapper Shubhneet Singh a.k.a Shubh is 26 years old. He has 13.1 million monthly listeners on Spotify, 3.25M subscribers on YouTube, and 1.1 million followers on Instagram. Not too long back, his followers included Virat Kohli and cricketers like Hardik Pandya KL Rahul.According to a Wikipedia page that has sprung up, his Still Rollin world tour was to include Bengaluru, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Ludhiana, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Mumbai, Kolkata and Pune.But all that is in the past tense now, because of a six-month-old Instagram post that Shubh had later deleted.In March this year, Shubh had shot into the limelight in India when he had posted an Instagram story that showed an illustration of a police officer unplugging an illuminated India map.The map had Jammu Kashmir, Ladakh and the Northeast states missing, and Punjab was blackened. As caption to the post, Shubh had written: Pray for Punjab.It caused a furore online, with many including Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut calling out the Indo-Canadian rapper.Shubh had later deleted the post, and posted an image with only the caption, Pray for Punjab.This was at the time the Punjab police had launched a massive manhunt for separatist preacher Amritpal Singh.But Shubh’s post resurfaced to haunt him, and one main reason was that the ties between India and Canada hit their lowest point in decades after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau dropped this bombshell in his country’s Parliament. That too, shortly after visiting New Delhi for the G-20 Summit: “Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing a potential link between agents of the Government of India and the killing of a Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar…”What has followed since then has become a full-blown diplomatic spat, with both India and Canada expelling a diplomat each from the other country. India has also issued a travel advisory for Canada.In the heat and dust of this tension with Canada, Shubhneet Singh was to perform in India.As it usually happens in such situations, an organisation approached Mumbai police, pointing to the Indo-Canadian rappers Instagram post. What followed was a swift domino effect.On September 19, gadget brand BOAT withdrew sponsorship of the rapper’s tour. The company said on social media: “At BOAT, while our commitment upgrade to the incredible music community runs deep, we are first and foremost a true Indian brand. Therefore, when we became aware of the remarks by artist Shubh earlier this year, we chose to withdraw our sponsorship for the tour….”A day later, Book My Show, which was the ticketing agent for Shubhneet Singh’s shows, posted on social media: Singer Shubhneet Singh’s Still Rollin Tour for India stands cancelled. To that end, BookMyShow has initiated a complete refund of the ticket amount for all consumers who had purchased tickets for the show. The refund will be reflected within 7-10 working days in the customer's source account of the original transaction.The repercussions have not ended for Shubhneet Singh a.k.a Shubh, with reports of music apps pulling down his tunes coming in fast.Incidentally, India’s pointing to Canada harbouring Khalistani agents is not new. Do remember that the bombing of the Air India flight Kanishka in 1985 was the deadliest act of aviation terrorism till 9/11.Anchor: Srirupa RayAudio production: Sahil Gupta\",\n",
       " \"The first drink that one has in the morning can have far reaching impact on one’s health.While there are many morning drinks and beverages that are claimed to support weight loss, it's essential to remember that no single drink can guarantee significant weight loss on its own. Weight loss is a complex process that involves a combination of a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and healthy lifestyle choices. However, some morning drinks can complement your weight loss efforts by boosting metabolism, promoting satiety, or providing essential nutrients. Here are a few such morning drinks that may support your weight loss goals: Warm lemon waterA glass of warm water with lemon can kickstart your metabolism and aid digestion. Starting your day with warm lemon water helps rehydrate your body after a night's sleep and can be a refreshing alternative to plain water.

       " 'Amid the ongoing diplomatic row with India over the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a new opinion poll has got more worrying news for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.According to a new Ipsos poll conducted for the Canada-based news platform Global News, Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, has emerged as the preferred choice for Prime Minister among 40 percent of Canadian citizens. In contrast, PM Justin Trudeau lags behind with only 31 percent support.According to a Global News report, Ipsos CEO Darrell Bricker noted that the gap between Poilievre and Trudeau in leadership preferences indicates that the Conservatives could secure a majority government if an election were held today. Dissatisfaction with the country\\'s direction, particularly concerning economic concerns, such as the cost of living, access to housing, and inflation, has contributed to this sentiment.Pierre Poilievre\\'s popularity as the Conservative Leader has been steadily increasing, with 40 percent of Canadians now considering him the best choice for Prime Minister. This represents a five-point increase in his favorability ratings compared to the previous year. In contrast, Justin Trudeau\\'s support as the preferred Prime Minister has remained static at 31 percent. Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the NDP (New Democratic Party), who is known for his sympathies towards Khalistan and his coalition partnership with Prime Minister Trudeau, has experienced a four-point decline since September 2022. Currently, only 22 percent of respondents view him as the best choice to lead the government.The poll also delved into core issues affecting Canada, including the economy, healthcare, and housing. It revealed that a plurality of Canadians believe that Pierre Poilievre has the most compelling plans in all three of these areas.Time for Trudeau to step aside?While Justin Trudeau has reiterated his intention to lead the Liberal Party into the upcoming election, a majority of respondents do not view this as a favorable course of action.The Ipsos survey findings indicate that 60 percent of Canadians believe it\\'s time for Trudeau to step down as the leader, allowing someone else to take the reins of the Liberals in the forthcoming election. This marks an increase from the 54 percent recorded in a December 2022 poll. Poilievre demands more proof on Canada allegationsTensions flared between India and Canada early this week following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\\'s explosive allegations of the \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on his country\\'s soil on June 18 in British Columbia. India had designated Nijjar as a terrorist in 2020.India angrily rejected the allegations as \"absurd\" and \"motivated\" and expelled a senior Canadian diplomat in a tit-for-tat move to Ottawa\\'s expulsion of an Indian official over the case.Notably, Pierre Poilievre emphasized that the Canadian Prime Minister should provide all the relevant facts to the public, rather than just a statement, to allow Canadians to make informed judgments.(With inputs from agencies)',\n",

       " 'Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL), India’s longest sea bridge, is nearing completion with 96.60% work complete. Dr Sanjay Mukherjee, IAS and Commissioner of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) recently did a comprehensive inspection of the mammoth project. The MTHL spans 21.8 kilometers in length with over 16 kilometers long stretch over the sea. It connects Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and commuters will be able to traverse between the two places in just 20 minutes with signal free connectivity. The MTHL will eventually provide faster connectivity to the Mumbai-Goa highway, Mumbai-Pune expressway, Navi Mumbai International Airport and the JNPT port.As part of the inspection, Dr Mukherjee held a meeting with the stakeholders and reviewed the progress of the project. Dr Mukherjee expressed satisfaction at the progress of this ambitious project and said that the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link is a significant milestone in the development of the region. MMRDA aims to complete the project within the stipulated time and hopes that it will be successfully integrated into the transportation network of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. Some of the unique features of the MTHL include automated toll collection system and intelligent transport system. The Mumbai Trans Harbour Link project is being implemented in three civil works packages while package 4 will focus on the Intelligent Transport System (ITS), Automated Toll collection system, and electrical works. The bridge has Orthotropic steel deck (OSD) spans ranging from 65 meters to 180 meters in length - something that MMRDA says is a first for India. Yet another important aspect of MTHL, as highlighted by Dr Mukherjee, is that the lighting poles installed on the bridge have been designed to withstand weather related challenges in the deep sea. A total of 1,212 lighting poles will be installed of which 20% have already been put in place. The poles are equipped with a Central Control Monitoring System (CCMS) and will be suitable to survive the saline environment. They have a corrosion-free polyurethane coating, galvanization to prevent rust and prolong lifespan, and structural design to withstand high wind velocities. Also, the lighting poles will have a Lightning Protection System to prevent potential damage caused by lightning.Earlier this year, Dr Mukjherjee in an exclusive interview with TOI had said that the MTHL and its associated connecting projects will increase the state GDP by at least 5%. “They are estimated to increase the national GDP by 1%. So, that itself tells us what is the potential that this one bridge has. And this bridge is therefore called a game changer,” he had said. “Navi Mumbai was developed way back as the satellite city of Mumbai and it was connected by two bridges. One is the Thane Creek bridge and the other one is the Airoli bridge. This (MTHL) actually makes Mumbai the closest to Navi Mumbai and it connects the area called as Shivri in Mumbai to an area called as Uluwe, Chirude in Navi Mumbai,” Mukherjee had explained.According to Mukherjee, the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link project has been built with the most modern technology.

Ishan also scored decent runs in the West Indies. Ishan also played a really brilliant knock against Pakistan (in the Asia Cup),\" Harbhajan said.\"If I have to choose between KL Rahul and Sanju Samson, I would definitely pick KL Rahul. I will put KL Rahul ahead of Sanju. I am picking KL because of the stability he provides at No.4, and No.5. Samson is also a talented player and can hit sixes at will. I am his big fan. You can\\'t have three wicketkeeper-batters in a team. If there will be then it will be difficult to field all of them in the XI,\" he said.\"Sanju is talented but he will need to wait for his chance. He will have to wait for his time and turn.

       " 'KYIV: Ukraine carried out a fiery missile strike on Friday on the main headquarters of Russia\\'s Black Sea Fleet, a Russian official said. Videos and photos showed large plumes of smoke over the building in Sevastopol in annexed Crimea. The Russian-installed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said there was no information about casualties. He said firefighters were battling a blaze, and more emergency forces were being brought in, an indication that the fire could be massive. A stream of ambulances were arriving at the fleet\\'s headquarters and shrapnel was scattered hundreds of metres (yards) around, the Tass news agency reported. Razvozhayev initially warned Sevastopol residents that another attack was possible and urged them not to leave buildings or go to the city centre. He later said there was no longer any air strike danger but reiterated calls not to go to the central part of the city, saying roads were closed and and unspecified \"special efforts\" were underway. Ukrainian officials, who have claimed responsibility for a series of other recent attacks on Crimea, didn\\'t immediately announce Kyiv launched the strike. Sevastopol residents said they heard explosions in the skies and saw smoke, Russian news outlets reported. Images circulated in Ukrainian Telegram channels showed clouds of smoke over the seafront. The Associated Press could not immediately verify the videos. The attack comes a day after Russian missiles and artillery pounded cities across Ukraine, killing at least five people as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President Joe Biden and congressional leaders in Washington with an additional USD 24 billion aid package being considered. The port city of Sevastopol serves as the main base for Russia\\'s Black Sea Fleet. Last week, the Russian-installed authorities there accused Ukraine of attacking a strategic shipyard in the city, damaging two ships undergoing repairs and causing a fire at the facility. The Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in an act that most of the world considered illegal, has been a frequent target since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than 18 months ago. The attack on the shipyard was the biggest in weeks. In other developments, ongoing shelling in the southern Kherson region killed one man and injured another, said regional Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin. \"Kherson has been restless since the morning,\" he said on Telegram. Russian shelling sparked fires in a residential building and a garage. In Kharkiv, regional Gov.

       " \"The first drink that one has in the morning can have far reaching impact on one’s health.While there are many morning drinks and beverages that are claimed to support weight loss, it's essential to remember that no single drink can guarantee significant weight loss on its own. Weight loss is a complex process that involves a combination of a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and healthy lifestyle choices. However, some morning drinks can complement your weight loss efforts by boosting metabolism, promoting satiety, or providing essential nutrients. Here are a few such morning drinks that may support your weight loss goals: Warm lemon waterA glass of warm water with lemon can kickstart your metabolism and aid digestion. Starting your day with warm lemon water helps rehydrate your body after a night's sleep and can be a refreshing alternative to plain water. Lemons are an excellent source of vitamin C, which is known for its immune-boosting properties. Vitamin C also acts as an antioxidant, helping protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. Green teaGreen tea is packed with antioxidants that combat free radicals, potentially reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Its catechins, particularly EGCG, can boost metabolism, aiding in weight management. Regular consumption may lower the risk of heart disease, improve brain function, and reduce the risk of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Additionally, green tea can help regulate blood sugar levels, support oral health, and promote healthy skin by fighting signs of aging.Black coffeeBlack coffee is a low-calorie beverage that offers various potential benefits. It contains caffeine, which can boost alertness and concentration. Coffee is rich in antioxidants, which help protect cells from damage. Regular consumption may lower the risk of certain diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's, and some types of cancer. It may also support liver health and contribute to weight management by increasing metabolism and promoting fat burning. However, excessive consumption can lead to negative side effects, so moderation is key. Cinnamon teaCinnamon tea is a flavorful and aromatic beverage that may offer several potential benefits. It is rich in antioxidants, which can help combat oxidative stress and inflammation in the body. Consuming cinnamon tea may help regulate blood sugar levels, making it beneficial for individuals with diabetes or insulin resistance. Some studies suggest it could support heart health by lowering cholesterol levels and blood pressure. Additionally, cinnamon tea's warming properties may aid digestion and provide comfort from digestive discomfort. Aloe vera juiceAloe vera juice is derived from the Aloe vera plant and is known for its potential health benefits. It can soothe digestive discomfort, including acid reflux and irritable bowel syndrome. The juice is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, promoting skin health, reducing inflammation, and supporting the immune system. Aloe vera may also help regulate blood sugar levels, aid in weight management, and alleviate constipation. However, it should be consumed in moderation, as excessive intake can lead to digestive issues.Chia seed waterChia seed water is a nutritious beverage made by soaking chia seeds in water. It forms a gel-like consistency that can help promote hydration, as the seeds absorb water and release it gradually. Chia seeds are rich in fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants, which can support digestive health, reduce inflammation, and boost heart health. Additionally, chia seed water can aid in weight management by promoting a feeling of fullness and stabilizing blood sugar levels.Turmeric black pepper waterTurmeric pepper water combines the potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of turmeric with black pepper's bioavailability-enhancing effects. This beverage may help reduce inflammation, alleviate joint pain, and boost immune function. The active compound in turmeric, curcumin, has been studied for its potential to combat chronic diseases, aid digestion, and promote skin health. The inclusion of black pepper enhances curcumin absorption. Additionally, turmeric pepper water may aid weight management by increasing metabolism. While it offers potential health benefits, it should be consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet for optimal results.\",\n",

       " \"RAIPUR: A minor girl was gangraped for two days by a 31-year-old man and two of his friends inside a multi-level parking located just below the office of the additional SP and a few hundred meters from two police stations in Chhattisgarh capital Raipur.Police have arrested all three accused but the incident has triggered questions on law and order in the state capital.The incident took place on September 18-19 when the 17-year-old girl had gone to a multi-level parking building on GE Road near Jaistambh Chowk of Raipur to meet the prime suspect, Sikandar Jain, who had promised her a job. The building also houses the ASP’s office and is located between Moudhapara and Gol Bazar police stations.Sikandar allegedly forced himself on her in the guard room in the basement parking area, and told her to return the next day for “detailed discussions” if she wanted to get a job.Police say this was a trap to gangrape her. When she returned on September 19 for what she believed was a job interview, she found two other men with Sikandar, who he introduced as his friends Avinash Behra, 35, and Gaurav Raj, 32.Avinash and Gaurav took her to a parked car in the basement on the pretext of showing her some documents but gangraped her. She tried to fight back but was overpowered. They threatened to kill her if she complained to anyone, she told police.Once back home, she confided in her parents, who immediately took her to the police, who registered a case under Pocso Act. The three accused were arrested within hours. Preliminary investigation has found that the three had hatched a conspiracy to rape her.While Sikandar works as a security guard, Gaurav is a bank employee and Avinash is a contractor. Police have seized the car where she was raped.(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault.)\",\n",
       " 'MUMBAI: A special NIA trial court denying bail to dismissed police officer Sachin Waze has held that though the gelatin sticks planted in a vehicle parked in February 2021 near Antilia in south Mumbai were not connected to a detonator, it was sufficient to cause terror in the minds of people.\"Here in this case the attempt of the applicant (Waze) was to create terror in the mind of particular section of people and that is the Ambani Family\", said special Judge A M Patil and therefore Waze’s plea that sans detonator no terror could be caused, is devoid of merit.The court in its detailed reasoned order of September 16, made available now referred to witnesses and documents on record, to say that Waze and other co-accused tried to spread terror in the mind of Ambani family and when businessman Mansukh Hiran’s whose vehicle was allegedly used, denied to accept the February 25, 2021 act as his crime, they \"eliminated Mansukh by conspiring with each other. It was well planned murder.\" The court said every precaution was taken to escape the clutches of law.If released there is every possibility of Waze tampering with witnesses held by the court.Waze’s counsel Sajal Yadav had argued that the ex-cop was falsely implicated due to inter departmental rivalry, questioned the prosecution sanction and argued lack of evidence to show Waze had planted any explosives in the vehicle. The court said the sanction cannot be said to be improper at this stage and held that Waze was silent on details of the alleged internal rivalry.Yadav said no terror case under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) was made out against Waze and said there was no extortion call made to the industrialist and nor were his or family’s statement recorded.The motive alleged against the then assistant police inspector was only to \"regain his clout\" said Yadav and also argued that in the recent past when the Reliance hospital and BKC school received a bomb threat, anti-terror law provisions were not invoked.Special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves for National Investigation Agency (NIA) opposing Waze’s plea said the chargesheet makes his involvement in the crimes, to commit a \"terrorist act\" and the \"cold blooded murder\" of Hiran, \"crystal clear\".To regain clout was “not the only motive behind the crime’’ said the court. It added that witness statements show that Waze “tried to spread terror… to extort money’’ and used and placed the explosive laden Scorpio near Antilia. Waze was reinstated in the Mumbai police force in June 2020, after a long suspension and had an office in the police commissioner’s office compound said a key-witness, the court noted adding that Hiran’s son said the Scorpio in which explosives were laden was sold in November 2020 by his father to Waze and returned back next February first week on the grounds that he did not like it.The court said Waze’s bail plea makes no mention of him having the vehicle for over two months. On February 18, 2021, Hiran had lodged a theft report with the Vikhroli police of his Scorpio which he parked by the highway the previous day. Waze said that the theft case is not closed. The NIA said Hiran handed over the Scorpio keys on February 17 night to Waze.The court citing witness statements said Waze, mid February 2021, pursuant to a conspiracy “extorted huge cash amounts from bar owners.” The alleged murder of Hiran was on March 4, 2021.There are a total of 10 accused. “ Matter is serious,’’ said the special court, adding, “Many of the accused are still striving for bail. If all the accused and their advocates co-operate then the delay in trial can be avoided.’’ But mere ground of delay is insufficient to grant Waze bail, the order said.The order said a witness mentions that on March 5, 2021, police inspector Sunil Mane and co-accused met Waze , both then met the then Mumbai police chief in his office and came back at 3 pm for lunch. “In the statement of Vimala Hiran, it establishes the relevant motive and intention of applicant (Waze) and his co-accused in furtherance of larger conspiracy and commission of crime of murder of Mansukh Hiran, since Mansukh Hiran was not ready to take the blame of crime dated 25.02.2021 on his own. The applicant and co-accused hatched conspiracy and eliminated Mansukh Hiran.’’The reasoned 43-page order said, “Prima-facie, statements of protected witnesses corroborated about the presence of Sunil Mane in the office of applicant along with Mansukh Hiran and hatching of conspiracy by the applicant, Sunil Mane, Pradeep Sharma and others at the CP office compound, Andheri (East) and at other places in Mumbai. There is sufficient evidence on record which revealed that applicant had called Mansukh Hiran to his office from 27.02.2021 till 03.03.2021 so as to persuade Mansukh Hiran to take blame of the incident dated 25.02.2021’’ and added, “ It is also established that SIM card used by Sunil Mane in the murder of Mansukh Hiran was given to him by the applicant and which was given to the applicant by Vinayak Shinde through Naresh Gaur and further to Sunil Mane at the instance of Pradeep Sharma. There is ample of evidence to show that applicant and Mansukh Hiran had planned to alleged theft of said green colour Scorpio vehicle at the instance of the applicant on or prior to 17.02.2021 and applicant had full control and possession over the said Scorpio prior to 05.02.2021… It is also established that applicant along with his associates took the physical possession of the said Scorpio and kept the vehicle opposite Shikhar Kunj Building after planting of explosives near Antilia along with threat note.’’',\n",

Unfortunately in the scheme of things couldn’t find more screen time but as is was also wonderful. #Jawan'. Though Deepika is only credited as a special appearance in the film, to many it didn’t feel that way. The report in Hindustan Times suggested that Deepika’s role was not a cameo at all and in fact, Jawan was made to look like a SRK- Deepika film. Nayanthara who is a huge star down south, hasn't reportedly taken the snub well, which is the reason why she might not be seen in Bollywood projects as something similar might happen again. However, there is no confirmation to these reports. However, another recent report suggested that Nayanthara is keen on putting an end to these rumours. A fan club dedicated to Nayanthara has revealed that the actress is contemplating taking legal action against YouTube channels and individuals responsible for spreading these baseless rumours.She recently used her Instagram stories to share a heartfelt birthday message for Atlee, conveying her pride in his achievements.

       " 'NEW DELHI: IndiGo continues to look at “mitigating measures” as Pratt Whitey (PW) engine troubles show no signs of ebbing with the latter recently warning 600-700 engines will need to be checked globally over the next three years. While it is the world’s largest Airbus A320 family customer and could see a significant impact, the low cost carrier is still waiting to hear from PW on the number of engines that will need to be examined and simultaneously looking at alternate means to keep augmenting capacity and network — something it has been doing through the last year by wet leasing planes and extending lease of older planes.“We have challenges with Pratt and we need to see what is the impact of the new announcement. The sooner we get clarity, the better it is. There is already a supply chain issue and some of the groundings are driven by that,” IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers told TOI Friday. The airline has 324 aircraft at the moment that includes about 40 ATRs and two wet leased Boeing 777s. The rest are A320 family planes with half having PW engines and half powered by CFM’s Leap engines.Despite that fact that close to 50 planes have been grounded for months due to Pratt issues, IndiGo has been able to increase passenger carriage and network post Covid. “We are benefitting from the fact that prior to Covid some orders were placed which are being delivered as we speak. This year we are getting about 40 new planes, all powered by CFM Leap engines. We have extended leases; gone in for new wet leases and have two wide bodies on wet lease from Turkish Airlines. Have taken a whole lot of measures already over the past year in order to deal with these challenges and continue to do so. Therefore we recently wet leased 11 more planes,” Elbers said.As a result, last September IndiGo had 100 cities on its entire network while now that number is at 120. In pre-Covid 2019, it flew about 7.5 crore passengers while that number was 8.6 crore last fiscal and is expected to reach 10 crore this financial year. “Thanks to out mitigating measures we have been able to provide capacity in line with our guidance and have build our network. We keep scanning the market for options and run our company. We have very recently added six new international destinations — Tbilisi, Baku, Tashkent, Almaty, Nairobi and Jakarta — to our network. We are adding new city pairs (like Hyderabad-Colombo, Ahmedabad-Jeddah and Abu Dhabi),” he said.Apart from meeting current capacity challenges, IndiGo is preparing for the future as it has almost 1,000 planes on order to be delivered till mid 2030s. It is working on the manpower requirements and preparing to meet that. The A321XLR are expected by late 2024 which will fly nonstop till Europe and fast east. “The product will be finalised later as the Indian market is evolving very rapidly,” Elbers said.Meanwhile till its XLRs fly IndiGo to distant shores, it is banking on code shares with foreign airlines to build brand awareness in places like Europe and America where it is not well known.',\n",
       " 'The situation in the country has become dire. For the past year, nearly every month has brought with it a feeling of foreboding. This, many Pakistanis routinely tell themselves, is certainly the lowest and worst point.To offset paying more than double the usual price for basic goods, they ration every drop of petrol by seeking alternative transportation options, buying less food, cheaper food, the cheapest food — but nothing seems to work. The continuing political instability, one government after another, the ever-looming threat of military intervention and the general uncertainty have not helped the situation.All of this has happened, but there seems to be more in the offing. The regular hikes in the price of petrol, the imposition of electricity tariffs and increase in the sales tax have all turned an already unbearable situation into one that is potentially catastrophic.Despite holding cabinet meetings on the issue of high electricity rates — a consequence of the deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) — the caretaker prime minister is unable to act against the exorbitant tariffs. Human Rights Watch has requested the IMF to review the impact of economic adjustments in countries where vulnerable groups will be affected. However, so far that help has not been forthcoming here. There are only so many corners to cut, only so much water added to milk, sawdust added to flour and pebbles eaten with lentils. After some time, there is only water and no milk, only sawdust and no flour and only pebbles and no lentils. The latest increase in prices, which is apparently necessary to sustain the deal with the IMF, points to such a situation. For political scientists researching political decisions, matters proceed according to what people assess to be in their self-interest.The poor sufferBut such calculations break down when the people have nothing to lose. In Pakistan, there will soon be millions of people whose lives have been so utterly wrecked by unchecked inflation and the unaffordability of even basic goods that their reactions to hunger, homelessness and hopelessness will be entirely unpredictable.Those whose lives are not immediately threatened by the unavailability of food and housing will possibly die in other ways. For instance, one of the major industries in Pakistan that is being affected by the economic crisis is the pharmaceutical industry. Banks are unwilling to open letters of credit due to the continuing lack of foreign exchange. For the current set-up, the pharmaceutical industry is an area of concern.The foreign exchange shortage means that the country may be hurtling towards a dearth of lifesaving drugs and the raw material needed to manufacture them. One example of this was when Panadol became unavailable last year. While it is not a lifesaving drug, the fact that there was a shortage of such a commonly used medicine, which then persisted, reveals the weaknesses in the market.Add to this the fact that there has been an ongoing pricing dispute, with drug manufacturers saying that because of the increased price of imported raw material required to make drugs, they wanted to hike prices by almost 40 per cent across the board. The problem is that without material to make the drugs there simply will not be sufficient medicine available to the people who need them. It does not appear that anything else is being done to avert this crisis or solve the impasse. It is terrifying to consider what would happen if drugs required by diabetics or basic broad-spectrum antibiotics are suddenly off the shelves.Pakistan’s poor are desperate and have been so for a long while now. This latest economic crisis is going to alter the class demographics of the country in irreversible ways. Those who belong to the lower middle class will likely fall into poverty and the poor will become desperately poor.Political and economic chaosOnly those in the middle or upper middle class who survive on remittances will manage to hold on for a while, but their investments in property or other Pakistani assets are likely to be devalued as Pakistani currency loses more and more value, despite making short-term recoveries. All of this will mean dependence on the black market for medicines and any kind of goods that are not manufactured in Pakistan using Pakistani materials. In fact, it is unfortunate that very little is manufactured in Pakistan from purely indigenous material.Many analysts have sounded the alarm in recent months over the country’s dire political and economic situation. Not only have the warnings and assessments of these analysts been ignored but the crisis has exacerbated thanks to the ever-more reckless actions taken by existing government officials. The switchovers from one to another and then another set-up has made accountability elusive. The possibility of future accountability via elections also seems remote given the political instability that has been witnessed for several months now. This means that the country has fallen into a state where people are doing whatever they can and get away with breaking the rules. For those who follow the rules, pay taxes, vote and hope for a democratic country run based on laws, this is terrible news.The only class of Pakistanis that have been untouched and will remain untouched by the hell that has descended upon the people are the rich and the ultra-rich. With all their assets safely stowed away in Dubai or some similar financial haven, they can talk about the current circumstances as if they were just another topic for an after-dinner conversation.As things become worse and worse, these people will leave for their offshore havens, so the poor who have nothing left to lose cannot come after them. Meanwhile, innocent, honest, good and worthy Pakistanis will die because they believed in a country that did not believe in them.The column first appeared in the Dawn on September 20.

       " \"It was bad enough that Justin Trudeau had to swelter in New Delhi till September 12 because his plane failed him. Coming after an unusually public dressing down by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his outburst on September 19 accusing India of killing Khalistan leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar sealed his now-dead relationship with India.Canada is where wokeness and brightly patterned socks find their illogical home. Which would have been idyllic if their political parties were not so welcoming of bad guys of many stripes. Trudeau not only did himself a disservice but he has also, perversely, made Modi a hero in India, just before the general election — without a Balakot, to boot.The narrative of India tracking down its enemies in the far corners of Earth is so compelling. Internet memes are comparing Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to Mossad. Though we are a bit mystified. How did RAW get Nijjar halfway across the world, while our friendly neighbour Hafiz Mohammed Saeed bids fair to marking a century on Earth?Watch: Former RAW chief slams Trudeau's claims As Trudeau dialled up all those Five Eyes (FVEY) partners, he shone the light on how Canada is actually the Pakistan of the Western world. FVEY, whom he called on September 19 to say Indian ‘agents’ had assassinated a terror leader in Canada, will now be compelled to look more closely not only at how Canadians fund their politics and where that trail actually leads, but also to look in their own backyards.What happened in Surrey, British Columbia, will not stay in Surrey, British Columbia. Trudeau has created a problem not merely for Canada and India but also for his key allies, particularly the US and Britain.Jumping the gunCuriously, Trudeau said Canadian security agencies were pursuing “credible allegations”, not credible ‘intelligence’ or ‘evidence’, of a killing that happened three months ago.The ‘allegations’ came from two sources that the Canadian media has reported — Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, head of the banned-in-India Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), and Trudeau’s political partner Jagmeet Singh ‘Jimmy’ Dhaliwal.You would think a prime minister would address a serious national security affair armed with more than ‘allegations’. Unfortunately, after his statement, any Canadian investigation is likely to be ‘coloured’ to align with the official line, because, in the real world, politics determines everything.At around the same time that Trudeau was displaying righteous anger, a Congress party leader in Moga, Baljinder Singh Balli, was killed by gangster Arsh Dalla, Nijjar’s associate and currently enjoying Canadian hospitality. No allegations necessary here. Dalla announced it on Facebook.Why did Trudeau do it? Out of pique? Or is there something else? It’s an old story that Trudeau’s Liberal Party owes a lot of its political cache to Canada’s Sikh community. He can no longer distinguish between regular hardworking Sikhs and the extremists. The Sikhs are now the most politically influential community in Canada — the ‘Brampton Munda’ is more than a hip-hop number. The Khalistan project had quietened. But, in recent years, it has seen a fresh lease of life, in Canada, Britain, the US and Australia.Canada is starting a public inquiry into ‘election interference’, particularly by China, where Trudeau’s Liberals will likely find nowhere to hide, given their well-established close ties with Beijing. Jagmeet included Iran, India and Russia in that inquiry.As recently as May, China was running extraterritorial ‘secret’ police stations in Canada, under the benevolent gaze of the Trudeau government to target dissident Chinese. Any public inquiry will throw up these uncomfortable facts. Much better to throw India under the bus.Canadian pension funds and private equity companies are deeply invested in India. Indian students are the top source for Canada. The present political chasm is not good for business. But politics has a way of overlooking the obvious.Divided communityCanadian Sikhs are divided — the big battle is the control of gurdwaras and real estate masquerading as gurdwaras. This leads to a well-oiled immigration and funding racket that frankly flies in the face of the rule of law that Trudeau extolled.Second, India’s outreach to Sikhs overseas and removal of many from the blacklist pitted Khalistanis against Khalistanis and put up Trudeau’s back.For instance, Ripudaman Singh Malik, accused in the Kanishka bombing and killed in July 2022 in exactly the same way as Nijjar, wrote a letter to Modi complaining against other ‘anti-India’ Sikhs (read: Nijjar). And there are the inevitable links between organised crime and the drug trade.Watch: Is Trudeau's time coming to an end? A big source of funding and support for Khalistanis is Pakistan. These are funnelled through Pakistani missions in Canada and Britain. The next time you see a Khalistan protest on TV, look out for a map of Khalistan — it includes Delhi but not an inch of Pakistani Punjab.The Canadian government has gone where many have feared to tread. In 2018, a report by the Canadian ministry of public safety on the terror threat to Canada referenced “Sikh [Khalistani] extremist ideologies and movements” as being among the top five threats to Canada. Under pressure, the Trudeau government removed these references in an edited version in 2019, enabling Trudeau to make up with the community just before Baisakhi celebrations.The Modi-led government’s biggest strategic error was to open the Kartarpur corridor in 2019. It helped Pakistan revive a dormant Khalistan asset, a low-cost proxy. It did not help Modi win Sikh votes. Brampton, we have a problem.The writer is CEO, Ananta Aspen Centre.\",\n",

The Delhi University Students\\' Union (DUSU) polls were last held in 2019. The election could not be held in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19 while possible disruptions to the academic calendar prevented its conduct in 2022. Miranda House student Nikita highlighted the issue of security, especially during college fests. \"On numerous occasions, some women have found themselves in unexpected and alarming situations during these festivities. Incidents like these dampen the students\\' mood and also raise concern about their safety,\" she said. Last year, some men allegedly scaled the college walls during an open Diwali fest on the campus and indulged in \"cat-calling and sexist sloganeering\".

Bhumi, another student of the college, emphasised the need for proactive measures outside the campus. She proposed the presence of both female and male police personnel in the vicinity of girls\\' colleges to ensure discipline and safety. Nimisha, a final-year student, echoed her collegemates\\' sentiments and added that there should be menstrual leaves. The RSS-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and the Congress-backed National Students\\' Union of India (NSUI) released separate manifestos for women voters in the run-up to the polls. The NSUI, in its women\\'s manifesto, has promised menstrual leaves, emergency response system for distress calls and increased police patrolling outside colleges.

       " 'In the world of music, controversies are not uncommon, and they often add an intriguing layer to an artist\\'s career. One such controversy that is making headlines currently is related to singer Shubh and his canceled India Music Tour. It was an event that promised to be a grand celebration of music but ended up mired in controversy.It all started in March when Shubh shared a distorted map of India on his Instagram story. In the post, the map didn’t have regions like Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir. Accompanying the image was a caption that read, \"Pray for Punjab.\" This swiftly sparked criticism and allegations of tacitly supporting the Khalistani movement.He started getting backlash from different corners, and as it gained momentum, Shubh later removed the map from his Instagram story. In its place, he posted a simpler message that solely stated, \"Pray for Punjab,\" devoid of any accompanying visual element. While this alteration might have been an attempt at damage control, the initial post had already ignited significant scrutiny and raised questions about his stance regarding the Khalistan issue, leading to many issues, one being the cancellation of Shubh’s India Music Tour. Initially, Shubh didn’t react. His sponsors backed away, leading cricketers of India unfollwed him on social media, and he received a lot of flake. Finally, the artist has broken his silence over the matter. Taking to his social media story he wrote that as a young artist from Punjab, it was his dream to pin his music on the global map. However, the recent events have left him in a state of grief and he wishes to express himself.He confessed to being excited about the whole tour, and talked about the preparation, but unfortunately, fate had other plans.

       " 'NEW DELHI: Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Friday wrote a letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla over the issue of derogatory statement made by BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri against BSP MP Danish Ali.In his letter, Chowdhury urged Om Birla to take stringent action as per the rules against Ramesh Bidhuri for using \"brazenly abusive and unparliamentary words against a member of a leading political party, Danish Ali, who also happens to be from the minority community\".\"What is even more regrettable is the fact that this unprecedented, unfortunate and unsavoury incident has happened during the Special Session of the Parliament, that has been convened to commemorate 75 years of its history and that too, during the course of the discussion to mark the success of \\'Mission Chandrayan-3,\" Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury wrote.\"The incident also reflects the mindset against the opposition and the minority community. expunging the remarks from the records of the House has no meaningful impact. Considering the circumstances and the brazen violation of all norms and rules relating to the functioning of the House, it would only be appropriate to have the matter examined in detail by the Privileges Committee and punitive action taken against the errant Member, Ramesh Bidhuri,\" he added.Earlier today, Danil Ali also met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and KC Venugopal at the latter\\'s residence in Delhi. After meeting Danish Ali, Rahul Gandhi said, \"Nafrat ke Bazaar mein Mohabbat ki Dukan.\"Danish Ali said if action is not taken against Bidhuri for his remarks, then he could consider quitting the membership of the House. He also said that people had not elected him to listen to \"hate speeches\".Bidhuri made certain objectionable remarks targeted at Ali on Thursday night during a discussion in the Lok Sabha on the success of the Chandrayaan-3 mission.',\n",
       " \"It was bad enough that Justin Trudeau had to swelter in New Delhi till September 12 because his plane failed him. Coming after an unusually public dressing down by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his outburst on September 19 accusing India of killing Khalistan leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar sealed his now-dead relationship with India.Canada is where wokeness and brightly patterned socks find their illogical home. Which would have been idyllic if their political parties were not so welcoming of bad guys of many stripes. Trudeau not only did himself a disservice but he has also, perversely, made Modi a hero in India, just before the general election — without a Balakot, to boot.The narrative of India tracking down its enemies in the far corners of Earth is so compelling. Internet memes are comparing Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to Mossad. Though we are a bit mystified. How did RAW get Nijjar halfway across the world, while our friendly neighbour Hafiz Mohammed Saeed bids fair to marking a century on Earth?Watch: Former RAW chief slams Trudeau's claims As Trudeau dialled up all those Five Eyes (FVEY) partners, he shone the light on how Canada is actually the Pakistan of the Western world. FVEY, whom he called on September 19 to say Indian ‘agents’ had assassinated a terror leader in Canada, will now be compelled to look more closely not only at how Canadians fund their politics and where that trail actually leads, but also to look in their own backyards.What happened in Surrey, British Columbia, will not stay in Surrey, British Columbia. Trudeau has created a problem not merely for Canada and India but also for his key allies, particularly the US and Britain.Jumping the gunCuriously, Trudeau said Canadian security agencies were pursuing “credible allegations”, not credible ‘intelligence’ or ‘evidence’, of a killing that happened three months ago.The ‘allegations’ came from two sources that the Canadian media has reported — Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, head of the banned-in-India Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), and Trudeau’s political partner Jagmeet Singh ‘Jimmy’ Dhaliwal.You would think a prime minister would address a serious national security affair armed with more than ‘allegations’. Unfortunately, after his statement, any Canadian investigation is likely to be ‘coloured’ to align with the official line, because, in the real world, politics determines everything.At around the same time that Trudeau was displaying righteous anger, a Congress party leader in Moga, Baljinder Singh Balli, was killed by gangster Arsh Dalla, Nijjar’s associate and currently enjoying Canadian hospitality. No allegations necessary here. Dalla announced it on Facebook.Why did Trudeau do it? Out of pique? Or is there something else? It’s an old story that Trudeau’s Liberal Party owes a lot of its political cache to Canada’s Sikh community. He can no longer distinguish between regular hardworking Sikhs and the extremists. The Sikhs are now the most politically influential community in Canada — the ‘Brampton Munda’ is more than a hip-hop number. The Khalistan project had quietened. But, in recent years, it has seen a fresh lease of life, in Canada, Britain, the US and Australia.Canada is starting a public inquiry into ‘election interference’, particularly by China, where Trudeau’s Liberals will likely find nowhere to hide, given their well-established close ties with Beijing. Jagmeet included Iran, India and Russia in that inquiry.As recently as May, China was running extraterritorial ‘secret’ police stations in Canada, under the benevolent gaze of the Trudeau government to target dissident Chinese. Any public inquiry will throw up these uncomfortable facts. Much better to throw India under the bus.Canadian pension funds and private equity companies are deeply invested in India. Indian students are the top source for Canada. The present political chasm is not good for business. But politics has a way of overlooking the obvious.Divided communityCanadian Sikhs are divided — the big battle is the control of gurdwaras and real estate masquerading as gurdwaras. This leads to a well-oiled immigration and funding racket that frankly flies in the face of the rule of law that Trudeau extolled.Second, India’s outreach to Sikhs overseas and removal of many from the blacklist pitted Khalistanis against Khalistanis and put up Trudeau’s back.For instance, Ripudaman Singh Malik, accused in the Kanishka bombing and killed in July 2022 in exactly the same way as Nijjar, wrote a letter to Modi complaining against other ‘anti-India’ Sikhs (read: Nijjar). And there are the inevitable links between organised crime and the drug trade.Watch: Is Trudeau's time coming to an end? A big source of funding and support for Khalistanis is Pakistan. These are funnelled through Pakistani missions in Canada and Britain. The next time you see a Khalistan protest on TV, look out for a map of Khalistan — it includes Delhi but not an inch of Pakistani Punjab.The Canadian government has gone where many have feared to tread. In 2018, a report by the Canadian ministry of public safety on the terror threat to Canada referenced “Sikh [Khalistani] extremist ideologies and movements” as being among the top five threats to Canada. Under pressure, the Trudeau government removed these references in an edited version in 2019, enabling Trudeau to make up with the community just before Baisakhi celebrations.The Modi-led government’s biggest strategic error was to open the Kartarpur corridor in 2019. It helped Pakistan revive a dormant Khalistan asset, a low-cost proxy. It did not help Modi win Sikh votes. Brampton, we have a problem.The writer is CEO, Ananta Aspen Centre.\",\n",

However, historical data shows that this is not the first time the city has received copious rain during the June-September season. The city’s two weather stations have broken rain records (see graphic) at least in six seasons since 1870 at Nungambakkam and since 1961 at Meenambakkam. June to September are are active southwest monsoon months for the rest of the country, but the city usually gets some rain of about 450mm during this period because it lies in the rain shadow.

It is something we take seriously... Regardless of the country, we will stand up and defend our basic principles. And we will also consult closely with allies like Canada as they pursue their law enforcement and diplomatic process,” US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in response to a question about whether the incident could “drive a wedge” between the United States and India given their burgeoning ties. Sullivan refuses to confirm Biden’s Republic Day trip The White House backing of Ottawa in the face of India’s case that Canada has been indulgent towards extremists wanted in terrorism-related charges (including the slain Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar) has led to questions about US President Joe Biden’s potential visit to attend Republic Day celebrations in 2024 on New Delhi’s invitation. Asked if the Canada-India row would affect the trip, US NSA Jake Sullivan said, “I do not have anything to announce today about travel by the President to India in January or at any other time.” In fact, Sullivan accused sections of the US media of trying to drive a wedge between the United States and Canada on this issue. \"We have deep concerns about the allegations, and we would like to see this investigation carried forward and the perpetrators held to account,\" he said, asserting that Washington has been and will be n contact with the Indians at \"high levels\" on this issue.

The closing of ranks in the Anglospheric alliance (strictly speaking the US does not have an official language like the other four) came amid disquiet in Indian quarters that its diplomats were being spied on and are being implicated on the basis of leaks.

The Don franchise, featuring Shah Rukh Khan, is a contemporary take on the classic Bollywood film series that originally starred Amitabh Bachchan in the titular role. The franchise started with Don in 2006. SRK took on the iconic role of Don, a cunning and elusive criminal, originally portrayed by Amitabh Bachchan in the 1978 film of the same name.

The report in Hindustan Times suggested that Deepika’s role was not a cameo at all and in fact, Jawan was made to look like a SRK- Deepika film. Nayanthara who is a huge star down south, hasn't reportedly taken the snub well, which is the reason why she might not be seen in Bollywood projects as something similar might happen again.

       " 'It came as a shock when Farhan Akhtar recently announced that Shah Rukh Khan won\\'t a part of Don franchise and introduced Ranveer Singh as the new Don. Several fans had expressed their disappointment over the development. And now Farhan has finally broken his silence and revealed that he and SRK had creative differences over Don 3, however, they have parted mutually. In an interview with Variety, Farhan, who has directed Don and Don 2 starring Shah Rukh Khan, said that he is not in the position of replacing anybody. He stated that he wanted to take a certain direction with the story but somehow they just couldn\\'t find common ground. \"We just parted mutually knowing that it’s probably for the best. So that’s where it is,” he said. Farhan also said that he is excited to work with Ranveer in Don 3 as the actor is charged up and ready to go. He added that Don 3 is a big film purely from the point of view of an actor and they are excited to have Ranveer on board. \"His energy is energizing us, so to speak,” he mentioned. The Don franchise, featuring Shah Rukh Khan, is a contemporary take on the classic Bollywood film series that originally starred Amitabh Bachchan in the titular role. The franchise started with Don in 2006. SRK took on the iconic role of Don, a cunning and elusive criminal, originally portrayed by Amitabh Bachchan in the 1978 film of the same name. The success of Don led to the release of its sequel, Don 2, in 2011. Farhan returned as the director, and Shah Rukh Khan reprised his role as the titular character. The film received positive reviews and was a significant box office success. Also See: Best Hindi Movies of 2023 | Top 20 Hindi Movies of 2023 | Latest Hindi Movies',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: IndiGo continues to look at “mitigating measures” as Pratt Whitey (PW) engine troubles show no signs of ebbing with the latter recently warning 600-700 engines will need to be checked globally over the next three years. While it is the world’s largest Airbus A320 family customer and could see a significant impact, the low cost carrier is still waiting to hear from PW on the number of engines that will need to be examined and simultaneously looking at alternate means to keep augmenting capacity and network — something it has been doing through the last year by wet leasing planes and extending lease of older planes.“We have challenges with Pratt and we need to see what is the impact of the new announcement. The sooner we get clarity, the better it is. There is already a supply chain issue and some of the groundings are driven by that,” IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers told TOI Friday. The airline has 324 aircraft at the moment that includes about 40 ATRs and two wet leased Boeing 777s. The rest are A320 family planes with half having PW engines and half powered by CFM’s Leap engines.Despite that fact that close to 50 planes have been grounded for months due to Pratt issues, IndiGo has been able to increase passenger carriage and network post Covid. “We are benefitting from the fact that prior to Covid some orders were placed which are being delivered as we speak. This year we are getting about 40 new planes, all powered by CFM Leap engines. We have extended leases; gone in for new wet leases and have two wide bodies on wet lease from Turkish Airlines. Have taken a whole lot of measures already over the past year in order to deal with these challenges and continue to do so. Therefore we recently wet leased 11 more planes,” Elbers said.As a result, last September IndiGo had 100 cities on its entire network while now that number is at 120. In pre-Covid 2019, it flew about 7.5 crore passengers while that number was 8.6 crore last fiscal and is expected to reach 10 crore this financial year. “Thanks to out mitigating measures we have been able to provide capacity in line with our guidance and have build our network. We keep scanning the market for options and run our company. We have very recently added six new international destinations — Tbilisi, Baku, Tashkent, Almaty, Nairobi and Jakarta — to our network. We are adding new city pairs (like Hyderabad-Colombo, Ahmedabad-Jeddah and Abu Dhabi),” he said.Apart from meeting current capacity challenges, IndiGo is preparing for the future as it has almost 1,000 planes on order to be delivered till mid 2030s. It is working on the manpower requirements and preparing to meet that. The A321XLR are expected by late 2024 which will fly nonstop till Europe and fast east. “The product will be finalised later as the Indian market is evolving very rapidly,” Elbers said.Meanwhile till its XLRs fly IndiGo to distant shores, it is banking on code shares with foreign airlines to build brand awareness in places like Europe and America where it is not well known.',\n",

       " 'In the world of music, controversies are not uncommon, and they often add an intriguing layer to an artist\\'s career. One such controversy that is making headlines currently is related to singer Shubh and his canceled India Music Tour. It was an event that promised to be a grand celebration of music but ended up mired in controversy.It all started in March when Shubh shared a distorted map of India on his Instagram story. In the post, the map didn’t have regions like Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir. Accompanying the image was a caption that read, \"Pray for Punjab.\" This swiftly sparked criticism and allegations of tacitly supporting the Khalistani movement.He started getting backlash from different corners, and as it gained momentum, Shubh later removed the map from his Instagram story. In its place, he posted a simpler message that solely stated, \"Pray for Punjab,\" devoid of any accompanying visual element. While this alteration might have been an attempt at damage control, the initial post had already ignited significant scrutiny and raised questions about his stance regarding the Khalistan issue, leading to many issues, one being the cancellation of Shubh’s India Music Tour. Initially, Shubh didn’t react. His sponsors backed away, leading cricketers of India unfollwed him on social media, and he received a lot of flake. Finally, the artist has broken his silence over the matter. Taking to his social media story he wrote that as a young artist from Punjab, it was his dream to pin his music on the global map. However, the recent events have left him in a state of grief and he wishes to express himself.He confessed to being excited about the whole tour, and talked about the preparation, but unfortunately, fate had other plans. He further quoted that India is his country too, as he was born here. He expressed that he is proud to be a Punjabi and whatever he is today, he owes that to his land.Check out Shubh’s post on the India Tour controversy here: View this post on Instagram A post shared by SHUBH (@shubhworldwide) ]]>On the one hand, where a segment of the internet and many other people stood against Shubh, many artists from the Punjabi entertainment world showed their support for the artist. Sidhu Moose Wala’s team posted a story on the late singer’s official handle. The post mentioned that the hatred among the Sikh community is rising day by day. Without any substantial evidence, Sidhu was called a terrorist, and the same things are being done with Shubh as well.Here’s the exact post shared by Sidhu Moose Wala’s team Similarly, the ‘Qismat’ fame director Jagdeep Sidhu showed his support. He too shared a story for Shubh.

       " 'MUMBAI: A special NIA trial court denying bail to dismissed police officer Sachin Waze has held that though the gelatin sticks planted in a vehicle parked in February 2021 near Antilia in south Mumbai were not connected to a detonator, it was sufficient to cause terror in the minds of people.\"Here in this case the attempt of the applicant (Waze) was to create terror in the mind of particular section of people and that is the Ambani Family\", said special Judge A M Patil and therefore Waze’s plea that sans detonator no terror could be caused, is devoid of merit.The court in its detailed reasoned order of September 16, made available now referred to witnesses and documents on record, to say that Waze and other co-accused tried to spread terror in the mind of Ambani family and when businessman Mansukh Hiran’s whose vehicle was allegedly used, denied to accept the February 25, 2021 act as his crime, they \"eliminated Mansukh by conspiring with each other. It was well planned murder.\" The court said every precaution was taken to escape the clutches of law.If released there is every possibility of Waze tampering with witnesses held by the court.Waze’s counsel Sajal Yadav had argued that the ex-cop was falsely implicated due to inter departmental rivalry, questioned the prosecution sanction and argued lack of evidence to show Waze had planted any explosives in the vehicle. The court said the sanction cannot be said to be improper at this stage and held that Waze was silent on details of the alleged internal rivalry.Yadav said no terror case under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) was made out against Waze and said there was no extortion call made to the industrialist and nor were his or family’s statement recorded.The motive alleged against the then assistant police inspector was only to \"regain his clout\" said Yadav and also argued that in the recent past when the Reliance hospital and BKC school received a bomb threat, anti-terror law provisions were not invoked.Special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves for National Investigation Agency (NIA) opposing Waze’s plea said the chargesheet makes his involvement in the crimes, to commit a \"terrorist act\" and the \"cold blooded murder\" of Hiran, \"crystal clear\".To regain clout was “not the only motive behind the crime’’ said the court. It added that witness statements show that Waze “tried to spread terror… to extort money’’ and used and placed the explosive laden Scorpio near Antilia. Waze was reinstated in the Mumbai police force in June 2020, after a long suspension and had an office in the police commissioner’s office compound said a key-witness, the court noted adding that Hiran’s son said the Scorpio in which explosives were laden was sold in November 2020 by his father to Waze and returned back next February first week on the grounds that he did not like it.The court said Waze’s bail plea makes no mention of him having the vehicle for over two months. On February 18, 2021, Hiran had lodged a theft report with the Vikhroli police of his Scorpio which he parked by the highway the previous day. Waze said that the theft case is not closed. The NIA said Hiran handed over the Scorpio keys on February 17 night to Waze.The court citing witness statements said Waze, mid February 2021, pursuant to a conspiracy “extorted huge cash amounts from bar owners.” The alleged murder of Hiran was on March 4, 2021.There are a total of 10 accused. “ Matter is serious,’’ said the special court, adding, “Many of the accused are still striving for bail. If all the accused and their advocates co-operate then the delay in trial can be avoided.’’ But mere ground of delay is insufficient to grant Waze bail, the order said.The order said a witness mentions that on March 5, 2021, police inspector Sunil Mane and co-accused met Waze , both then met the then Mumbai police chief in his office and came back at 3 pm for lunch. “In the statement of Vimala Hiran, it establishes the relevant motive and intention of applicant (Waze) and his co-accused in furtherance of larger conspiracy and commission of crime of murder of Mansukh Hiran, since Mansukh Hiran was not ready to take the blame of crime dated 25.02.2021 on his own. The applicant and co-accused hatched conspiracy and eliminated Mansukh Hiran.’’The reasoned 43-page order said, “Prima-facie, statements of protected witnesses corroborated about the presence of Sunil Mane in the office of applicant along with Mansukh Hiran and hatching of conspiracy by the applicant, Sunil Mane, Pradeep Sharma and others at the CP office compound, Andheri (East) and at other places in Mumbai. There is sufficient evidence on record which revealed that applicant had called Mansukh Hiran to his office from 27.02.2021 till 03.03.2021 so as to persuade Mansukh Hiran to take blame of the incident dated 25.02.2021’’ and added, “ It is also established that SIM card used by Sunil Mane in the murder of Mansukh Hiran was given to him by the applicant and which was given to the applicant by Vinayak Shinde through Naresh Gaur and further to Sunil Mane at the instance of Pradeep Sharma. There is ample of evidence to show that applicant and Mansukh Hiran had planned to alleged theft of said green colour Scorpio vehicle at the instance of the applicant on or prior to 17.02.2021 and applicant had full control and possession over the said Scorpio prior to 05.02.2021… It is also established that applicant along with his associates took the physical possession of the said Scorpio and kept the vehicle opposite Shikhar Kunj Building after planting of explosives near Antilia along with threat note.’’',\n",

This tournament marks the first time India is solely hosting the Men\\'s ODI World Cup. \"Look, I have always said this, and there is no doubt in this, that if you want to win the World Cup, then you have to beat Australia. In 2007 when we won the World Cup, we defeated Australia in the semifinal. In 2011 when we won the World Cup, we beat Australia in the quarterfinal,\" Gambhir said to Star Sports. \"Australia is the strongest team in any ICC tournament.

You can be in any position in the rankings, but Australia, when it comes to those big tournaments, the World Cups, I think Australia has got the players, they have got the self-belief, Australia has the ability to play those big moments really well.\"Gambhir highlighted the historical significance of facing Australia in crucial stages of World Cup campaigns, saying, \"And you can see this, the three World Cups that India won, we had to beat Australia in the knockout stage two times. And the World Cups that we have lost, in 2015 we lost to Australia. So I believe that if we have to win the World Cup this year, Australia is going to be the most important game, and we start against Australia, so there is nothing better than that.

They have got a few question marks going into this World Cup, for sure, with a few positions and some injuries they have had, but the players they have got, they certainly know how to step up in these big games,\" Watson said.\"And India, being at home, they\\'d know the conditions better than anyone, their bowlers are obviously on fire at the moment, with their quicks and also Kuldeep Yadav who is only getting better and better.

Sharing her assessment of the Russia-Ukraine war situation, the ambassador also told TOI’s Sachin Parashar in an exclusive interview that the G20 New Delhi Leaders’ Declaration upheld the UN Charter that Russia is violating, and thanked India for the leadership it has provided to the Group under its presidency. While Smith ruled out any expansion of Nato membership into the Indo-Pacific, she said the alliance is open to engagement with countries in the region the way it has engaged with Japan, Republic of Korea, Australia and New Zealand, countries that have shown interest, as she added, in sharing best practices and lessons learnt ``as it relates to China and Russia’s hybrid tactics’’.Excerpts:Nineteen months after Russia invaded Ukraine, there’s no end to the war in sight and Nato, in fact, is still warning allies to prepare for a long war. What will it take to end this war?Nato allies are continuing to support Ukraine’s efforts to defend its territory against Russian aggression. We have tried over many months to get Russia to stop the war. We have used unprecedented sanctions. We have isolated Russia on the world stage. We have warned them about the dangers of escalation and most importantly, we have reminded them that they are violating the core principles of the UN Charter as it relates to sovereignty and territorial integrity. Sadly, the Russians have not stopped this war. Not only are they battling Ukrainian forces, but they are pursuing these indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure. They are also targeting grain storage facilities and trying to starve or likely freeze over the winter Ukrainians to make it harder for citizens to go about their everyday lives. So, our support will continue. The counter-offensive has been underway for the past couple of months. The Ukrainians have made some very important advances over the past few weeks, but we do anticipate that the weather will change soon. It will become much muddier in Ukraine and for that reason some of the fighting will slow down. We are very much hoping that the Russians do not return to the tactics they pursued last winter. We hope they won’t start attacking the energy grid inside Ukraine, but we fear they will. And so, we want to help the Ukrainians prepare for a possible cold winter as wellMoscow believes its position on the war has been vindicated by the G20 declaration that didn’t condemn Russia. How does that help in convincing Russia to end the war? Also, what do you make of the assessment by Indian authorities that the G20 consensus on Ukraine could provide a pathway to resolving the conflict?Couple of things on that front. Let me thank India for its presidency of G20. We appreciate the leadership India has provided. I also want to thank India for the important humanitarian assistance that it is providing to Ukraine. We don’t agree with the statement that it was watered down. What we liked seeing was the reference to those 2 principles in the UN Charter – sovereignty and territorial integrity. I think collectively the G20 agreed that it is important to protect those 2 principles. The consensus among the G20 was that we must uphold international law and protect the UN Charter. Russia is clearly violating the UN Charter at the moment, and we take comfort from the fact that the global community seems concerned about what Russia is doing, both for its direct aggression against Ukrainian forces and people and because of what they are fundamentally doing to the UN Charter. Our perspective is that India appreciates and G20 members appreciate that and collectively we all want this war to end.You have wanted India to take the initiative for any engagement with Nato. Do you notice any willingness now? Also, do you see India playing any sort of role in ending the war?Well, Nato remains open minded about possible dialogue with India but ultimately it’s a decision that rests in the hands of our friends in India. Should they be interested in dialogue with Nato allies as some of the like-minded democracies with shared values, we would be open to that. We could foresee engagement on a couple of different issues. India might find it helpful to share our collective experiences in dealing with climate security and climate change. Maybe we could have a conversation about non-proliferation, maritime security, cyber security. But again, no pressure from the Nato side. We leave it in India’s hands. On the war in Ukraine, we appreciate India’s efforts to try and get both sides to come to the negotiating table. We applaud any country’s efforts to do so as long as that country is willing to engage both Ukrainians and Russians. It cannot be one sided. India showed a willingness to do that but sadly none of the efforts that have been pursued till now have succeeded in convincing the Russians to stop the war but we will support other country’s efforts to try and end this war.Nato has criticised China for its opaque intentions and military buildup. Looking ahead, and beyond the partnership with countries like Japan, Australia New Zealand and South Korea, what sort of role do you see Nato playing to facilitate efforts to ensure a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific where the rule of law is followed?Well, I want to be clear that Nato is a Euro-Atlantic alliance and will remain so. Nato is not looking to expand its membership into the Indo-Pacific. All that said, we do have some formal partners in the Indo-Pacific. You named them. These are 4 countries that have expressed interest in partnering with the Nato alliance, not joining it. They are interested in sharing best practices, lessons learnt as it relates to China’s hybrid tactics but also Russia’s hybrid tactics and the deepening relationship between China and Russia. Going forward, Nato is open to engaging in dialogue with other countries in the Indo-Pacific if they would find that useful but I’d say bilaterally, separate from Nato, the US is also working with India through Quad in the Indo-Pacific and that provides us a formal process and structure to work with our friends in India to benefit from their knowledge and expertise and to learn from and share things with each other as we all work to bring peace and stability to the Indo-Pacific and keep it free and open. So, we will continue to look for bilateral engagements with India, we will continue to work with them though Quad and going forward, if India has any interest in engaging in dialogue with Nato, again we would see some benefit in doing so.What do you make of Ukraine’s demand for more modern weapons to repel Russian forces? Also, what’s the status of the proposal for Ukraine’s membership of Nato? Is it a done deal or will they have to wait for now?Ukraine has the right to defend its territory. They are being attacked. It’s unprovoked aggression pursued by Russia. Again, Russia could end the war today if it so desired and so till that happens, I think there will be a collection of countries including the US and allies who are willing to assist Ukraine as they defend their territory. We are not putting troops in Ukraine, and we are not party to the conflict, but we believe they have a right to self-defense as stated in the UN Charter. On their membership aspirations, Nato has been quite clear. We have said that their future place is in Nato and in 2008 we said they will ultimately become a member of the alliance. But right now, while there is a full-scale war unfolding on their territory, we believe the most important thing we can be doing is to provide practical assistance so that they can end the war and get Russia out of its territory. Over the long term, we all collectively see that Ukraine will someday become a member of the alliance and we were able to reaffirm that when we just had the summit in Vilnius 2 months ago.',\n",

       " 'LUCKNOW: BJP national general secretary, Sunil Bansal, said on Friday that his party will come up with a “special plan” for the 14 Lok Sabha seats they were unable to win in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Bansal made this announcement while reviewing the BJP\\'s election preparations in the Mainpuri, Ambedkarnagar, Shrawasti, Lalganj, and Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituencies. Rae Bareli is currently represented by senior Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav\\'s wife, Dimple Yadav, is the MP from Mainpuri. Similarly, Shrawasti, Lalganj, and Ambedkarnagar are held by the BSP.Former UP BJP general secretary (organisation), Bansal, played a pivotal role as one of the key poll strategists for the saffron outfit that achieved a significant victory in the 2017 assembly elections. He is currently responsible for Telangana, Odisha, and West Bengal and also oversees the Lok Sabha seats in UP that the BJP failed to win in 2019.“Work has to be done by making strategy at the booth level. More and more people need to be covered under PM Vishwakarma Yojana and Ayushman scheme (envisaging free medical treatment up to Rs 5 lakh).” He made these remarks during a meeting chaired by UP BJP chief Bhupendra Chaudhary and attended by state general secretary (organization) Dharam Pal Singh, as well as several other senior leaders.The meeting also included BJP Vistaraks (full-time BJP workers deployed to provide independent feedback).Bansal categorically underscored the need of taking government policies to the grass root level by establishing contact and communication with youth, farmers, women and beneficiaries at the booth level. He said that “micromanagement” and “teamwork at the booth level” will hold the key for BJP to achieve the target of winning all 80 Lok Sabha in UP. He also stressed on the importance of establishing communication with senior party workers.Chaudhary pointed out that despite the opposition (SP, BSP, and RLD) forming an alliance, the BJP managed to secure over 50% of the votes in 2019. He maintained that the political environment was favorable for the BJP under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. He also stated that the BJP had fulfilled all the promises made to the people in its election manifestos, saying, \"BJP does what it says, and this mindset makes the party omnipresent.\"Dharampal Singh said that a strong booth structure was the key `mantra’ that will bring victory for the BJP in 2024.

This remarkable achievement marks only the second occasion in men's cricket history that a team has attained the No.1 ranking across all formats. Previously, South Africa accomplished this remarkable feat in August 2012.India (116 rating points) dislodged Pakistan (115) to climb to the top of the ICC ODI rankings.

       " \"NEW DELHI: An all-round India eased past a formidable Australia by five wickets in the series opener in Mohali to script a rare rankings history on Friday. With the comfortable win, not only India took a 1-0 series lead, the team also became the no.1 ODI side in the latest ICC rankings. Already at the numero uno spot in the Test and T20I formats, India achieved a rare feat, becoming the top-ranked side across all three formats. Before the start of the series, India were tied with arch-rivals Pakistan at 115 points in ODIs but a win today has taken India a point clear in the 50-over format. The architects of India's win were pacer Mohammed Shami and the young openers Shubman Gill and Ruturaj Gaikwad, who played impactful knocks to set up the win. After a Shami fifer restricted a batting-heavy Australia to 276 all out, new opening pair of Gill and Ruturaj shared a massive 142-run opening stand. Stand-in skipper KL Rahul and Suryakumar Yadav too hit crucial half-centuries as India chased down the total with 8 balls to spare.Here's a look at the key moments of the series opener at the IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali. Early Marsh blow and a 94-run standAs India won the toss and opted to bowl, Shami got the hosts off to a perfect start, dismissing dangerous Mitchell Marsh four balls into the contest. As a Shami’s jaffa took the outside edge of Marsh's bat, Gill completed an easy catch to give Australia an early blow. With a wicket down in the first over itself, Australia's most experienced batters David Warner and Steve Smith joined hands to stitch a terrific second-wicket partnership. The duo added 94 runs, stabilised the innings and laid a solid platform for their side. Scoring at the quick rate as well, the Warner-Smith partnership came off just 106 balls with Warner (52) getting to his 29th ODI fifty amid a solid stand. However, all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja eventually broke the threatening stand, removing Warner soon after his fifty in the 19th over.Quick wickets peg back Australia but middle-order fights backWith Jadeja managing to break the solid second wicket stand, it opened the door for India to make a comeback. India grabbed the chance with both hands as Smith soon joined Warner back to the pavilion. Shami came back into the attack and knocked over Smith for 41, India now had two wickets in quick succession. The bowlers then bowled tight lines in the middle overs to restrict Australia's scoring. Marnus Labuschagne and Cameron Green did manage a 45-run stand but looked a bit jittery in the middle. While the India fielders were a bit sloppy, luck did go their way when Labuschagne suffered an unfortunate stumping in the 33rd over. Labuschagne tried to reverse sweep Ashwin, but the ball hit keeper KL Rahul's pad and went on to hit the stumps with the batter's backfoot over the line. After the fall of Labuschagne, there was another brief stand but a really bad mix-up between Green and Josh Inglis cost the former his wicket for 31. With loss of wickets at regular intervals, Australia were 186 for 5 in the 40th over and were in desperate need of a partnership when all-rounder Marcus Stoinis arrived in the middle. With his counterattacking strokeplay, Stoinis alongside with Inglis tried to put pressure back on India. As boundaries came thick and fast, both quickly raised a 62-run stand but Shami came back and got rid of a dangerous-looking Stoinis for 29 in the 47th over. In the very next over, Jasprit Bumrah deceived Inglis and the Aussie keeper departed for a well-made run-a-ball 45.Shami fifer and Cummins cameoLooking to up the scoring rate, as Australia lost set Stoinis and Inglis, Shami then ran through the lower order with two quick wickets. Dismissing Matthew Short and Sean Abbott for 2 and 2 respectively, Shami registered his best ever figures of 5/51 in the format. With the fifer, Shami (37) also became the second most successful bowler after legendary Kapil Dev (45) against Australia in ODIs. With Australia staring at an all out situation, skipper Pat Cummins got in a few boundaries taking Australia to a competitive total. His 9-ball 21 cameo provided the finishing touches before the last man Adam Zampa got run out off the final ball of the innings.The perfect startChasing a competitive total, India's new opening pair of Shubman Gill and Ruturaj Gaikwad got off to a perfect start. In the form of his life, Gill began aggressively in the chase while Ruturaj, who will be leading the Indian team in the Asian Games, too made a confident start. As the duo got going, boundaries flew thick and fast for the hosts inside the first Powerplay. The duo added 66 runs in the first 10 overs, setting the tone for the chase. Taking on the Australian bowlers, both continued with their aggressive approach, helping India cross the 100-run park in the 16th over. In the process, Gill got to his 9th ODI fifty off just 37 balls, Ruturaj too followed him soon, raising his bat for the first time in ODIs -- a fifty off 61 balls. As the duo kept on going, Australians looked absolutely clueless. But then Adam Zampa provided the much-needed breakthrough, trapping Ruturaj with a slider in the 22nd over. By the time Ruturaj fell, India had 142 runs on the board.The wobbleWith the openers adding 142 runs at the top, the chase looked like a cakewalk for India. But the relentless Aussies, soon after Ruturaj fell, pounced onto the opportunity and struck multiple times in a very short span of time. One over after Ruturaj's dismissal, comeback man Shreyas Iyer (3) threw away his wicket, calling out for an impossible run. Set Shubman too made the long walk back for 74 an over after Iyer's dismissal as he missed a slider from Zampa. From 142 for 0, India were now 151 for 3 in the 26th over. With a partnership needed to steady the wobble, skipper KL Rahul and Ishan Kishan joined hands and moved forward cautiously. Ishan did try to hit occasional boundaries but Rahul was focussed more on rotating the strike. However, after a brief recovery, Cummins returned to remove Ishan for 28 in the 33rd over with India under 100 runs away from the target.Rahul, Surya take India homeWhen Ishan fell, India were still 92 runs away from target and the Australians had their tails up but experienced batters KL Rahul and Suryakumar Yadav understood the situation perfectly and just didn't take any risks. With the asking rate below 6 RPO, both focussed on rotation of strike along with putting away the occasional bad balls. With the two batters not taking any risks, they kept the Australian bowlers at bay. Wickets were the only solution for Australia to make a comeback but Rahul and Surya ensured there were no further hiccups. Under-pressure Surya, who was under the pump for his below-par batting performances in the ODIs, stepped up to the occasion, playing a mature knock. As the duo added 80 runs for the fifth wicket, Surya notched up his 3rd ODI fifty off 47 balls. But soon after his fifty, Surya played a rash shot and got out. But by the time Surya departed India were close to the finish line. Rahul ensured he took India home safely from there. Raising his 14th fifty, Rahul (58 not out) along with Ravindra Jadeja (3 not out) took India home with 8 balls to spare.\",\n",

While the ISL-10 season opener between the two teams at the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium on Thursday, which Blasters won 2-1, largely remained incident free, an episode during the second half has kicked up a storm.While the club management has taken strong exception to the nose-pinching gesture of BFC winger Ryan Williams towards Blasters\\' defender Aibanbha Dohling, the fans have gone to the extent of terming it a \\'racist act\\'.The incident happened during the 82nd minute of the match. During a heated argument between the two players, Williams apparently pinched his nose while confronting Blasters\\' Meghalayan defender.The Blasters\\' management is mulling the option of taking up the matter with the Indian Super League authorities. It is learnt that they are in process of collecting more video evidence of the incident before presenting it to ISL officials. \"At present, we don\\'t find a racist angle to the incident, but it is a bad gesture on the part of the visiting player and we would like ISL to take a look into it,\" said the source.Meanwhile, Manjappada, the official fan base of Blasters issued a statement demanding action against Williams. \"Zero tolerance for racism! We strictly condemn the racial gestures by Bengaluru FC player Ryan Williams to Aiban. AIFF and the Indian Super League must act decisively against the player involved. Racism has no place in our game,\" said a statement from Manjappada.Earlier, in 2007 French Football Association (FFA) had handed a three-match ban on Lyon\\'s Milan Baros for pinching his nose before Stade Rennes\\' Stephane M\\'bia. Barros also waved his hand as if he was repelling an offensive odour. The FFA in its final verdict mentioned that the gesture was not racist, but the player was suspended for three games for the deplorable action.',\n",

Artificial Intelligence has immense potential to rewrite the course of Indian healthcare. Its future can be more precise, personalised and predictive. In fact, as per a report from the World Economic Forum, AI expenditure in India is expected to touch $11.78 billion by 2025 and is expected to add $1 trillion to India’s economy by 2035.How can upskilling in digital health technology be a game-changer for professionals?Digital health technologies are vital because they empower medical professionals to get a holistic view of their patients’ health and also patients are in more control of their treatment trajectories.

       " 'MUMBAI: Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa recently resolved that its office is directed to follow the procedure laid down last August by the Supreme Court and issue two year provisional enrolment certificate to a law graduate already employed elsewhere. The State Bar Council in July resolved that such certificate will have a stamp of validity of two years and its office will also issue a letter that says on successfully clearing the AIBE examination such person would undertake to take a call within six months to either resign or join the profession or remain in the same job. Failure to so communicate to the Bar Council will render the sanad (enrolment certificate) suspended as directed by the SC.The State Bar Council secretary Pravin Ranpise had on September 13 communicated its resolution of July 8, to advocates Anuj Gupta and Amit Gupta from Navi Mumbai who had complained about “exorbitant charges levied while issuing sanads bering arbitrary validity periods.’’ They said Rs 15000 each was charged from them towards a six month provisional enrolment into the Bar which they had paid last December.Last December the State Bar council in its decision on Gupta’s application, post the SC ruling to enrol while having a job, had resolved to grant provisional enrolment certificates to candidates already in other jobs and gave the candidate six months within which to clear the bar examination. The duo said the SC had in its order only assigned six month from the date of passing the All India Bar Exam (AIBE) for an undertaking to be given on whether or not the sanad holder will give up their existing jobs.Gupta filed an application under the Right to Information Act (RTI) with the Bar Council of India (BCI) which on March 29, 2023 stated that candidates already in other employment are required to clear the AIBE in two years and are also entitled to appear for the AIBE sans any restriction on number of attempts.The duo claimed that reducing the validity period to six months in their case was improper.But with the Maharashtra State Bar Council order issued this month, advocate Anuj Gupta said it paves the way for them and hundreds others who are employed but can now also get a provisional sanad for two years within which to clear the AIBE after which they will get six months to decide whether to join the bar and practice law or stay in the job they had.“We are happy with the SC order and will abide by it. The two year buffer will enable professionals or those already employed elsewhere to decide if they want to practice or continue in their existing jobs,” said advocate Uday Warunjikar, vice chairperson of State Bar Council.',\n",
       " 'In 1970s, Amitabh Bachchan delivered some of his career\\'s most iconic performances in films like ‘Zanjeer’, ‘Deewar’, ‘Sholay’, and ‘Muqaddar Ka Sikandar’. Simultaneously, he showed his versatility by associating with the legendary director Hrishikesh Mukherjee, working in classics like ‘Abhimaan’, ‘Chupke Chupke’, ‘Anand’, and ‘Namak Haram’. This collaboration enriched Bachchan\\'s repertoire, taking him beyond the emblematic \\'angry young man\\' image that remains imprinted in public memory even today. However, the road to stardom wasn\\'t without its challenges for Amitabh Bachchan. One such intriguing tale from his early years highlights the unique hurdles he faced. The megastar recently reminisced about an episode during the shooting of the 1971 film, \\'Anand\\', where he was berated by the director, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, and the director of photography (DOP) for having \"exceptionally red lips.\" Bachchan took to his personal blog to share an image from the film \\'Anand\\' and playfully wrote about a fan complimenting his lips. He used the opportunity to narrate the backstory of that image. Apparently, when he appeared on set, the film\\'s director and DOP would often exclaim, \"Why have you applied lipstick? Wipe it off immediately!\" To their disbelief, Bachchan clarified that his lips were naturally that red. Even the makeup artist, after attempting to remove any trace of lipstick, confirmed Bachchan\\'s claim. Left with no other choice, the director and DOP then decided to tone down the brightness of his lips by applying base makeup to them. In his blog, Amitabh Bachchan humorously elaborated that what fans see in his pictures from that era is not lipstick but the base makeup used to dull the natural vibrancy of his lips. After enduring over half a century of ups and downs in the film industry, his lips, he noted, might have lost their natural brightness but continue to draw attention. In his concluding words, Bachchan humorously remarked, \"So, despite the \\'lipstick\\' controversies, if my lips still capture attention after 53 years, what more could I ask for?\" The anecdote gives a fascinating glimpse into the challenges and unexpected incidents that even legends like Amitabh Bachchan faced during their illustrious careers.',\n",

Under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) offences are categorised on quantity of the contraband and attract severe sentencing if amounts are labelled \"commercial\". For Ganja, the small amount is 1 kg and 20 kg and above is commercial, the in between amount is intermediate.Sagar Borkar, an accused was arrested on January 8, 2022, after Bharati Vidyapeeth Police Station, Pune for the offences punishable under Sections 8(c) (possession of commercial quantity), 22(b)(ii)(c) and 29 (criminal conspiracy). Borkar was found with 10.3 kg of ganjan. Police also arrested a co-accused who was found with 11.2 kgs of Ganja.Borkar had applied for bail before the HC, after the special trial Judge in Pune rejected it. Justice Dige in a September 15 order, after hearing Borkar’s lawyer Ganesh Gupta and state prosecutor P N Dabholkar said: \"In my view, though applicant and co-accused found together, they were carrying the contraband individually. The recovery of the contraband from the possession of the Applicant and co-accused should be considered separately and as observed by this Court\", in a case of Rashida Khan in a 2006 case.The prosecutor had argued that since the combined weight was commercial, rigours of section 37 of the NDPS Act would apply in a bail plea. The HC citing the previous position taken by the HC in the 2006 order, considered Borkar\\'s possession individually and since it was lesser than commercial quantity the strict bail provisions did not apply.The HC granted Borkar bail of Rs 25000 subject to him attending the police once a month for two hours till charges are framed.',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON: The Biden White House on Thursday threw its weight behind Ottawa’s investigation of allegations about India’s hand in the “assassination” of a pro-Khalistan separatist in Canada in June, saying it took the accusation seriously and that “there is not some special exemption you get for actions like this”. “It is a matter of concern for us. It is something we take seriously... Regardless of the country, we will stand up and defend our basic principles. And we will also consult closely with allies like Canada as they pursue their law enforcement and diplomatic process,” US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in response to a question about whether the incident could “drive a wedge” between the United States and India given their burgeoning ties. Sullivan refuses to confirm Biden’s Republic Day trip The White House backing of Ottawa in the face of India’s case that Canada has been indulgent towards extremists wanted in terrorism-related charges (including the slain Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar) has led to questions about US President Joe Biden’s potential visit to attend Republic Day celebrations in 2024 on New Delhi’s invitation. Asked if the Canada-India row would affect the trip, US NSA Jake Sullivan said, “I do not have anything to announce today about travel by the President to India in January or at any other time.” In fact, Sullivan accused sections of the US media of trying to drive a wedge between the United States and Canada on this issue. \"We have deep concerns about the allegations, and we would like to see this investigation carried forward and the perpetrators held to account,\" he said, asserting that Washington has been and will be n contact with the Indians at \"high levels\" on this issue. Sullivan\\'s remarks came after the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported claims by the Trudeau government that it had \"amassed\" both human and electronic intelligence pointing to the involvement of Indian officials in the killing. Some was provided by an unnamed ally in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, it said citing unnamed sources. The Five Eyes alliance comprises the US, Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand. The alliance, described by some as \"one of the most comprehensive known espionage alliances in human history\" exchanges information obtained through signals intelligence -- basically electronic eavesdropping -- and also human intelligence (spycraft) and geospatial intelligence (through use of satellites). The closing of ranks in the Anglospheric alliance (strictly speaking the US does not have an official language like the other four) came amid disquiet in Indian quarters that its diplomats were being spied on and are being implicated on the basis of leaks. The Liberal Trudeau government is under pressure from Conservative opposition in Canada to back up its allegations against India with evidence, which New Delhi says has not been shared with it. Separately though, foreign ministers of the Quad group, which has the US, India, Australia, and Japan met at the UN on Friday and called on \"all countries to uphold purposes and principles (of the UN Charter), including refraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. \"We underscore our commitment to upholding international law as the foundation for stability and equitable treatment of all member states,\" a joint statement issued by the group said, in a broad statement that could apply as much to Canada as India. In a specific reference to terrorism, which India has implicitly accused Canada of turning a blind eye to, the statement said \"We are committed to countering terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including preventing the international and cross border movement of terrorists, and countering terror finance networks and safe havens. We stressed the need for a comprehensive and balanced approach to effectively curb terrorist activities through whole of nation and whole of international community efforts.\"The White House backing of Ottawa in the face of India\\'s case that Canada has been indulgent towards extremists wanted in terrorism-related charges (including the slain militant Hardeep Singh Nijjar) has cast a shadow on the invitation New Delhi has extended to President Biden to attend Republic Day celebrations in January 2024. Asked whether the Canada-India imbroglio would affect the trip, Sullivan said, \"I do not have anything to announce about travel by the President to India in January or at any other time today.\"',\n",

With the comfortable win, not only India took a 1-0 series lead, the team also became the no.1 ODI side in the latest ICC rankings. Already at the numero uno spot in the Test and T20I formats, India achieved a rare feat, becoming the top-ranked side across all three formats. Before the start of the series, India were tied with arch-rivals Pakistan at 115 points in ODIs but a win today has taken India a point clear in the 50-over format.

After a Shami fifer restricted a batting-heavy Australia to 276 all out, new opening pair of Gill and Ruturaj shared a massive 142-run opening stand. Stand-in skipper KL Rahul and Suryakumar Yadav too hit crucial half-centuries as India chased down the total with 8 balls to spare.Here's a look at the key moments of the series opener at the IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali. Early Marsh blow and a 94-run standAs India won the toss and opted to bowl, Shami got the hosts off to a perfect start, dismissing dangerous Mitchell Marsh four balls into the contest. As a Shami’s jaffa took the outside edge of Marsh's bat, Gill completed an easy catch to give Australia an early blow. With a wicket down in the first over itself, Australia's most experienced batters David Warner and Steve Smith joined hands to stitch a terrific second-wicket partnership. The duo added 94 runs, stabilised the innings and laid a solid platform for their side. Scoring at the quick rate as well, the Warner-Smith partnership came off just 106 balls with Warner (52) getting to his 29th ODI fifty amid a solid stand. However, all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja eventually broke the threatening stand, removing Warner soon after his fifty in the 19th over.Quick wickets peg back Australia but middle-order fights backWith Jadeja managing to break the solid second wicket stand, it opened the door for India to make a comeback. India grabbed the chance with both hands as Smith soon joined Warner back to the pavilion. Shami came back into the attack and knocked over Smith for 41, India now had two wickets in quick succession. The bowlers then bowled tight lines in the middle overs to restrict Australia's scoring. Marnus Labuschagne and Cameron Green did manage a 45-run stand but looked a bit jittery in the middle. While the India fielders were a bit sloppy, luck did go their way when Labuschagne suffered an unfortunate stumping in the 33rd over. Labuschagne tried to reverse sweep Ashwin, but the ball hit keeper KL Rahul's pad and went on to hit the stumps with the batter's backfoot over the line. After the fall of Labuschagne, there was another brief stand but a really bad mix-up between Green and Josh Inglis cost the former his wicket for 31. With loss of wickets at regular intervals, Australia were 186 for 5 in the 40th over and were in desperate need of a partnership when all-rounder Marcus Stoinis arrived in the middle. With his counterattacking strokeplay, Stoinis alongside with Inglis tried to put pressure back on India. As boundaries came thick and fast, both quickly raised a 62-run stand but Shami came back and got rid of a dangerous-looking Stoinis for 29 in the 47th over. In the very next over, Jasprit Bumrah deceived Inglis and the Aussie keeper departed for a well-made run-a-ball 45.Shami fifer and Cummins cameoLooking to up the scoring rate, as Australia lost set Stoinis and Inglis, Shami then ran through the lower order with two quick wickets. Dismissing Matthew Short and Sean Abbott for 2 and 2 respectively, Shami registered his best ever figures of 5/51 in the format. With the fifer, Shami (37) also became the second most successful bowler after legendary Kapil Dev (45) against Australia in ODIs. With Australia staring at an all out situation, skipper Pat Cummins got in a few boundaries taking Australia to a competitive total. His 9-ball 21 cameo provided the finishing touches before the last man Adam Zampa got run out off the final ball of the innings.The perfect startChasing a competitive total, India's new opening pair of Shubman Gill and Ruturaj Gaikwad got off to a perfect start. In the form of his life, Gill began aggressively in the chase while Ruturaj, who will be leading the Indian team in the Asian Games, too made a confident start. As the duo got going, boundaries flew thick and fast for the hosts inside the first Powerplay. The duo added 66 runs in the first 10 overs, setting the tone for the chase. Taking on the Australian bowlers, both continued with their aggressive approach, helping India cross the 100-run park in the 16th over. In the process, Gill got to his 9th ODI fifty off just 37 balls, Ruturaj too followed him soon, raising his bat for the first time in ODIs -- a fifty off 61 balls. As the duo kept on going, Australians looked absolutely clueless. But then Adam Zampa provided the much-needed breakthrough, trapping Ruturaj with a slider in the 22nd over. By the time Ruturaj fell, India had 142 runs on the board.The wobbleWith the openers adding 142 runs at the top, the chase looked like a cakewalk for India. But the relentless Aussies, soon after Ruturaj fell, pounced onto the opportunity and struck multiple times in a very short span of time. One over after Ruturaj's dismissal, comeback man Shreyas Iyer (3) threw away his wicket, calling out for an impossible run. Set Shubman too made the long walk back for 74 an over after Iyer's dismissal as he missed a slider from Zampa. From 142 for 0, India were now 151 for 3 in the 26th over. With a partnership needed to steady the wobble, skipper KL Rahul and Ishan Kishan joined hands and moved forward cautiously. Ishan did try to hit occasional boundaries but Rahul was focussed more on rotating the strike. However, after a brief recovery, Cummins returned to remove Ishan for 28 in the 33rd over with India under 100 runs away from the target.Rahul, Surya take India homeWhen Ishan fell, India were still 92 runs away from target and the Australians had their tails up but experienced batters KL Rahul and Suryakumar Yadav understood the situation perfectly and just didn't take any risks. With the asking rate below 6 RPO, both focussed on rotation of strike along with putting away the occasional bad balls. With the two batters not taking any risks, they kept the Australian bowlers at bay. Wickets were the only solution for Australia to make a comeback but Rahul and Surya ensured there were no further hiccups. Under-pressure Surya, who was under the pump for his below-par batting performances in the ODIs, stepped up to the occasion, playing a mature knock. As the duo added 80 runs for the fifth wicket, Surya notched up his 3rd ODI fifty off 47 balls. But soon after his fifty, Surya played a rash shot and got out. But by the time Surya departed India were close to the finish line. Rahul ensured he took India home safely from there. Raising his 14th fifty, Rahul (58 not out) along with Ravindra Jadeja (3 not out) took India home with 8 balls to spare.\",\n",

The report also stated that the south star was upset with Deepika Padukone's cameo being elevated in the film, over her. Amidst this, a fan told Shah Rukh Khan on social media, ' loved Azad’s bond with Suji …the single mom storyline was so subtly done and really refreshing. Thank you for representing women from all walks of life. Love you Shah @iamsrk #AskSRK #Jawan'. Check out the post here:Replying to the post, SRK wrote, 'I also felt that the story of Narmada as a single mom was amazing. Unfortunately in the scheme of things couldn’t find more screen time but as is was also wonderful. #Jawan'. Though Deepika is only credited as a special appearance in the film, to many it didn’t feel that way. The report in Hindustan Times suggested that Deepika’s role was not a cameo at all and in fact, Jawan was made to look like a SRK- Deepika film. Nayanthara who is a huge star down south, hasn't reportedly taken the snub well, which is the reason why she might not be seen in Bollywood projects as something similar might happen again. However, there is no confirmation to these reports. However, another recent report suggested that Nayanthara is keen on putting an end to these rumours. A fan club dedicated to Nayanthara has revealed that the actress is contemplating taking legal action against YouTube channels and individuals responsible for spreading these baseless rumours.She recently used her Instagram stories to share a heartfelt birthday message for Atlee, conveying her pride in his achievements. This modest act by the actress conveyed a significant message and swiftly put to rest any speculations of discord between them.'Jawan', meanwhile, is making record-breaking collections at the box office.\",\n",
       " 'Vivek Ramaswamy, the Indian-American Republican presidential candidate, has delivered a significant foreign policy address in his home state of Ohio, outlining his vision for achieving economic independence from China. He proposed a series of measures aimed at realizing this goal, along with fostering stronger ties with countries like India.Several Republican primary contenders have shown a willingness to confront China\\'s aggressive actions through tariffs, with former President Donald Trump being the most prominent advocate of this approach. However, many have expressed reluctance to disrupt existing trade relationships with Beijing. But Ramaswamy asserted that there\\'s no time for terms like \"de-risking\" or \"diversifying.\" Instead, Ramaswamy is set to introduce a resolute \"pro-trade strategy for sensibly decoupling from China.\"Speaking to a gathering at a plastics manufacturing facility in New Albany, Ohio, Ramaswamy emphasized that our primary adversary today is not the USSR, which dissolved in 1990, but rather Communist China.The biotech entrepreneur contends that his trade-centric approach represents the only \"substantive\" effort among GOP candidates. He aims to modernize the Reagan Doctrine by shifting its focus from \"peace through strength\" to \"prosperity through peace.\"Ramaswamy emphasized the imperative of reducing reliance on Chinese-controlled pharmaceutical supply chains and increasing military spending as part of his strategy. He stressed that his approach offers a practical and clear path to declare economic independence from China while concurrently advancing domestic prosperity.The 38-year-old entrepreneur, whose popularity has been on the rise following his impressive performance in the first Republican presidential primary debate last month, elaborated on following key elements of his policy:Declaring Independence from the Climate Change Agenda: Ramaswamy criticized the climate change agenda as a \"farce\" and a \"hoax\" and pledged to declare independence from it.Increased Military Spending: Ramaswamy called for heightened military spending to enhance homeland defense capabilities.Moving Away from Chinese-controlled Pharmaceutical Supply Chains: Expressing concerns about potential contamination, he advocated distancing the United States from pharmaceutical supply chains controlled by China, especially regarding legal pharmaceuticals.Economic Independence from Taiwan: He proposed boosting the production of US semiconductors, the essential components powering phones, satellite systems, medical devices, and communication devices, to achieve economic independence from Taiwan.Ramaswamy pointed out the Chinese Communist Party\\'s tactics of building barriers for market entry when criticizing China and rolling out the red carpet for those who criticize the United States. He cited examples, including BlackRock\\'s CEO Larry Fink\\'s lobbying efforts, to illustrate this dynamic.\"Take BlackRock, the first asset manager ever to be granted the right to sell mutual funds as a foreign asset manager in China. How did they get it? It was only after BlackRock\\'s CEO Larry Fink lobbied in the United States for lowered listing standards for Chinese companies in the US,\" he claimed.He emphasized that, if elected as President in November 2024, he would focus on achieving economic independence from China and highlighted the president\\'s unique role in shaping foreign policy.Ramaswamy stressed his commitment to avoiding World War III, revitalizing national pride, and dismantling regulatory obstacles under the executive branch, without having to rely on Congress for approval or forgiveness. He cautioned against making legislative promises contingent on Congress, referencing former President Donald Trump\\'s unfulfilled pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare as an example of such challenges.(With inputs from agencies)',\n",

So that’s where it is,” he said. Farhan also said that he is excited to work with Ranveer in Don 3 as the actor is charged up and ready to go. He added that Don 3 is a big film purely from the point of view of an actor and they are excited to have Ranveer on board. \"His energy is energizing us, so to speak,” he mentioned. The Don franchise, featuring Shah Rukh Khan, is a contemporary take on the classic Bollywood film series that originally starred Amitabh Bachchan in the titular role. The franchise started with Don in 2006. SRK took on the iconic role of Don, a cunning and elusive criminal, originally portrayed by Amitabh Bachchan in the 1978 film of the same name. The success of Don led to the release of its sequel, Don 2, in 2011. Farhan returned as the director, and Shah Rukh Khan reprised his role as the titular character.

       " 'Nato is ready to enter into dialogue with India on issues like nonproliferation, maritime security, cyber security and climate but it won’t apply any pressure on India to engage with the Euro-Atlantic alliance, said US Permanent Representative to Nato Julianne Smith. Sharing her assessment of the Russia-Ukraine war situation, the ambassador also told TOI’s Sachin Parashar in an exclusive interview that the G20 New Delhi Leaders’ Declaration upheld the UN Charter that Russia is violating, and thanked India for the leadership it has provided to the Group under its presidency. While Smith ruled out any expansion of Nato membership into the Indo-Pacific, she said the alliance is open to engagement with countries in the region the way it has engaged with Japan, Republic of Korea, Australia and New Zealand, countries that have shown interest, as she added, in sharing best practices and lessons learnt ``as it relates to China and Russia’s hybrid tactics’’.Excerpts:Nineteen months after Russia invaded Ukraine, there’s no end to the war in sight and Nato, in fact, is still warning allies to prepare for a long war. What will it take to end this war?Nato allies are continuing to support Ukraine’s efforts to defend its territory against Russian aggression. We have tried over many months to get Russia to stop the war. We have used unprecedented sanctions. We have isolated Russia on the world stage. We have warned them about the dangers of escalation and most importantly, we have reminded them that they are violating the core principles of the UN Charter as it relates to sovereignty and territorial integrity. Sadly, the Russians have not stopped this war. Not only are they battling Ukrainian forces, but they are pursuing these indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure. They are also targeting grain storage facilities and trying to starve or likely freeze over the winter Ukrainians to make it harder for citizens to go about their everyday lives. So, our support will continue. The counter-offensive has been underway for the past couple of months. The Ukrainians have made some very important advances over the past few weeks, but we do anticipate that the weather will change soon. It will become much muddier in Ukraine and for that reason some of the fighting will slow down. We are very much hoping that the Russians do not return to the tactics they pursued last winter. We hope they won’t start attacking the energy grid inside Ukraine, but we fear they will. And so, we want to help the Ukrainians prepare for a possible cold winter as wellMoscow believes its position on the war has been vindicated by the G20 declaration that didn’t condemn Russia. How does that help in convincing Russia to end the war? Also, what do you make of the assessment by Indian authorities that the G20 consensus on Ukraine could provide a pathway to resolving the conflict?Couple of things on that front. Let me thank India for its presidency of G20. We appreciate the leadership India has provided. I also want to thank India for the important humanitarian assistance that it is providing to Ukraine. We don’t agree with the statement that it was watered down. What we liked seeing was the reference to those 2 principles in the UN Charter – sovereignty and territorial integrity. I think collectively the G20 agreed that it is important to protect those 2 principles. The consensus among the G20 was that we must uphold international law and protect the UN Charter. Russia is clearly violating the UN Charter at the moment, and we take comfort from the fact that the global community seems concerned about what Russia is doing, both for its direct aggression against Ukrainian forces and people and because of what they are fundamentally doing to the UN Charter. Our perspective is that India appreciates and G20 members appreciate that and collectively we all want this war to end.You have wanted India to take the initiative for any engagement with Nato. Do you notice any willingness now? Also, do you see India playing any sort of role in ending the war?Well, Nato remains open minded about possible dialogue with India but ultimately it’s a decision that rests in the hands of our friends in India. Should they be interested in dialogue with Nato allies as some of the like-minded democracies with shared values, we would be open to that. We could foresee engagement on a couple of different issues. India might find it helpful to share our collective experiences in dealing with climate security and climate change. Maybe we could have a conversation about non-proliferation, maritime security, cyber security. But again, no pressure from the Nato side. We leave it in India’s hands. On the war in Ukraine, we appreciate India’s efforts to try and get both sides to come to the negotiating table. We applaud any country’s efforts to do so as long as that country is willing to engage both Ukrainians and Russians. It cannot be one sided. India showed a willingness to do that but sadly none of the efforts that have been pursued till now have succeeded in convincing the Russians to stop the war but we will support other country’s efforts to try and end this war.Nato has criticised China for its opaque intentions and military buildup. Looking ahead, and beyond the partnership with countries like Japan, Australia New Zealand and South Korea, what sort of role do you see Nato playing to facilitate efforts to ensure a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific where the rule of law is followed?Well, I want to be clear that Nato is a Euro-Atlantic alliance and will remain so. Nato is not looking to expand its membership into the Indo-Pacific. All that said, we do have some formal partners in the Indo-Pacific. You named them. These are 4 countries that have expressed interest in partnering with the Nato alliance, not joining it. They are interested in sharing best practices, lessons learnt as it relates to China’s hybrid tactics but also Russia’s hybrid tactics and the deepening relationship between China and Russia. Going forward, Nato is open to engaging in dialogue with other countries in the Indo-Pacific if they would find that useful but I’d say bilaterally, separate from Nato, the US is also working with India through Quad in the Indo-Pacific and that provides us a formal process and structure to work with our friends in India to benefit from their knowledge and expertise and to learn from and share things with each other as we all work to bring peace and stability to the Indo-Pacific and keep it free and open. So, we will continue to look for bilateral engagements with India, we will continue to work with them though Quad and going forward, if India has any interest in engaging in dialogue with Nato, again we would see some benefit in doing so.What do you make of Ukraine’s demand for more modern weapons to repel Russian forces? Also, what’s the status of the proposal for Ukraine’s membership of Nato? Is it a done deal or will they have to wait for now?Ukraine has the right to defend its territory. They are being attacked. It’s unprovoked aggression pursued by Russia. Again, Russia could end the war today if it so desired and so till that happens, I think there will be a collection of countries including the US and allies who are willing to assist Ukraine as they defend their territory. We are not putting troops in Ukraine, and we are not party to the conflict, but we believe they have a right to self-defense as stated in the UN Charter. On their membership aspirations, Nato has been quite clear. We have said that their future place is in Nato and in 2008 we said they will ultimately become a member of the alliance. But right now, while there is a full-scale war unfolding on their territory, we believe the most important thing we can be doing is to provide practical assistance so that they can end the war and get Russia out of its territory. Over the long term, we all collectively see that Ukraine will someday become a member of the alliance and we were able to reaffirm that when we just had the summit in Vilnius 2 months ago.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: Gautam Gambhir, former India opener and a key member of the 2011 Men\\'s ODI World Cup-winning team, has emphasised the significance of India\\'s opening encounter against Australia in the upcoming mega event. Gambhir believes that if Rohit Sharma\\'s side aims to clinch the coveted trophy, the clash against Australia will be the most pivotal game of their campaign.India, the champions of 1983 and 2011, will commence their quest in the 13th edition of the Men\\'s ODI World Cup with a showdown against the five-time champions, Australia, on October 8 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. This tournament marks the first time India is solely hosting the Men\\'s ODI World Cup. \"Look, I have always said this, and there is no doubt in this, that if you want to win the World Cup, then you have to beat Australia. In 2007 when we won the World Cup, we defeated Australia in the semifinal. In 2011 when we won the World Cup, we beat Australia in the quarterfinal,\" Gambhir said to Star Sports. \"Australia is the strongest team in any ICC tournament. Remove the ranking, ranking does not matter. You can be in any position in the rankings, but Australia, when it comes to those big tournaments, the World Cups, I think Australia has got the players, they have got the self-belief, Australia has the ability to play those big moments really well.\"Gambhir highlighted the historical significance of facing Australia in crucial stages of World Cup campaigns, saying, \"And you can see this, the three World Cups that India won, we had to beat Australia in the knockout stage two times. And the World Cups that we have lost, in 2015 we lost to Australia. So I believe that if we have to win the World Cup this year, Australia is going to be the most important game, and we start against Australia, so there is nothing better than that. So beating Australia is very, very important.\"On the other hand, Shane Watson, a former member of Australia\\'s World Cup-winning teams in 2007 and 2015, envisions a tantalising prospect of an India-Australia final in the 2023 edition of the competition. Watson expressed his support for the Pat Cummins-led Australian side, expecting them to rise to the occasion in crucial league-stage matches.\"Definitely going to back Australia with the calibre of players they have. They have got a few question marks going into this World Cup, for sure, with a few positions and some injuries they have had, but the players they have got, they certainly know how to step up in these big games,\" Watson said.\"And India, being at home, they\\'d know the conditions better than anyone, their bowlers are obviously on fire at the moment, with their quicks and also Kuldeep Yadav who is only getting better and better. So India with their firepower, especially with their top order in particular, they certainly can go all the way. So for me, Australia and India would be an incredible final,\" Watson added.(With IANS inputs)',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday called for the immediate implementation of the women\\'s reservation bill and expressed \"100% regret\" that the proposed legislation during the UPA government did not include reservation for OBCs. The former Congress president also demanded that the Centre carry out a caste census and make public its findings along with that of the previous caste census conducted during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) rule. Noting that the government\\'s intention behind bringing the bill was political, he said it will not be implemented in the next 10 years as it has been linked to the population census and the delimitation exercise.The bill was meant for diverting attention from the growing call for a caste census, he said.He also alleged that the BJP MPs have no role in decision-making and they are like mere \"moortis\" (idols) in a temple without any power given to them. \"The truth is that this bill will be implemented in 10 years from now, if it is implemented at all,\" he claimed at a press conference at the party headquarters, a day after Parliament approved the legislation to reserve a third of seats in the Lok Sabha and state assemblies for women.Gandhi said that while he favoured the bill, he sought more reservation for women from backward classes and other sections as per their population ratios.Asked if he regretted that the erstwhile UPA government did not give OBC quota in its women\\'s reservation bill that was passed by Rajya Sabha in 2010, Gandhi said, \"There is 100% regret. We should have done that back then and we will get this done now.\"The women\\'s reservation bill is a good thing, but two \"footnotes\" of census and delimitation have been attached to it which will take many years to give this reservation to women, he said.\"Share on basis of population - this is the right of our OBC brothers and sisters! Release the caste census data now, do the new census on the basis of caste. Implement women\\'s reservation now, not after 10 years,\" Gandhi later posted on X in Hindi.The Congress said delimitation and census were \"poor excuses\" for postponement of the bill\\'s implementation and alleged that the entire exercise was to create an election issue, without actually implementing it. The opposition party also dubbed the bill a \"teasing illusion\".(With inputs from agencies)',\n",

       " 'LUCKNOW: BJP national general secretary, Sunil Bansal, said on Friday that his party will come up with a “special plan” for the 14 Lok Sabha seats they were unable to win in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Bansal made this announcement while reviewing the BJP\\'s election preparations in the Mainpuri, Ambedkarnagar, Shrawasti, Lalganj, and Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituencies. Rae Bareli is currently represented by senior Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav\\'s wife, Dimple Yadav, is the MP from Mainpuri. Similarly, Shrawasti, Lalganj, and Ambedkarnagar are held by the BSP.Former UP BJP general secretary (organisation), Bansal, played a pivotal role as one of the key poll strategists for the saffron outfit that achieved a significant victory in the 2017 assembly elections. He is currently responsible for Telangana, Odisha, and West Bengal and also oversees the Lok Sabha seats in UP that the BJP failed to win in 2019.“Work has to be done by making strategy at the booth level. More and more people need to be covered under PM Vishwakarma Yojana and Ayushman scheme (envisaging free medical treatment up to Rs 5 lakh).” He made these remarks during a meeting chaired by UP BJP chief Bhupendra Chaudhary and attended by state general secretary (organization) Dharam Pal Singh, as well as several other senior leaders.The meeting also included BJP Vistaraks (full-time BJP workers deployed to provide independent feedback).Bansal categorically underscored the need of taking government policies to the grass root level by establishing contact and communication with youth, farmers, women and beneficiaries at the booth level. He said that “micromanagement” and “teamwork at the booth level” will hold the key for BJP to achieve the target of winning all 80 Lok Sabha in UP. He also stressed on the importance of establishing communication with senior party workers.Chaudhary pointed out that despite the opposition (SP, BSP, and RLD) forming an alliance, the BJP managed to secure over 50% of the votes in 2019. He maintained that the political environment was favorable for the BJP under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. He also stated that the BJP had fulfilled all the promises made to the people in its election manifestos, saying, \"BJP does what it says, and this mindset makes the party omnipresent.\"Dharampal Singh said that a strong booth structure was the key `mantra’ that will bring victory for the BJP in 2024.

I\\'m used to it, I love it,\" Rahul said about leading the side in place of regular skipper Rohit Sharma.\"I think the intensity in the afternoon was great, after Colombo this felt like heaven at the start but it was really hot and humid.

But managed to build a good partnership with Surya, need to put myself in such challenging situations.\"We kept talking about hitting good cricket shots, rotating the strike and this is something all our batters are working on.

       " 'In the world of music, controversies are not uncommon, and they often add an intriguing layer to an artist\\'s career. One such controversy that is making headlines currently is related to singer Shubh and his canceled India Music Tour. It was an event that promised to be a grand celebration of music but ended up mired in controversy.It all started in March when Shubh shared a distorted map of India on his Instagram story. In the post, the map didn’t have regions like Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir. Accompanying the image was a caption that read, \"Pray for Punjab.\" This swiftly sparked criticism and allegations of tacitly supporting the Khalistani movement.He started getting backlash from different corners, and as it gained momentum, Shubh later removed the map from his Instagram story. In its place, he posted a simpler message that solely stated, \"Pray for Punjab,\" devoid of any accompanying visual element. While this alteration might have been an attempt at damage control, the initial post had already ignited significant scrutiny and raised questions about his stance regarding the Khalistan issue, leading to many issues, one being the cancellation of Shubh’s India Music Tour. Initially, Shubh didn’t react. His sponsors backed away, leading cricketers of India unfollwed him on social media, and he received a lot of flake. Finally, the artist has broken his silence over the matter. Taking to his social media story he wrote that as a young artist from Punjab, it was his dream to pin his music on the global map. However, the recent events have left him in a state of grief and he wishes to express himself.He confessed to being excited about the whole tour, and talked about the preparation, but unfortunately, fate had other plans. He further quoted that India is his country too, as he was born here. He expressed that he is proud to be a Punjabi and whatever he is today, he owes that to his land.Check out Shubh’s post on the India Tour controversy here: View this post on Instagram A post shared by SHUBH (@shubhworldwide) ]]>On the one hand, where a segment of the internet and many other people stood against Shubh, many artists from the Punjabi entertainment world showed their support for the artist. Sidhu Moose Wala’s team posted a story on the late singer’s official handle. The post mentioned that the hatred among the Sikh community is rising day by day. Without any substantial evidence, Sidhu was called a terrorist, and the same things are being done with Shubh as well.Here’s the exact post shared by Sidhu Moose Wala’s team Similarly, the ‘Qismat’ fame director Jagdeep Sidhu showed his support. He too shared a story for Shubh. He simply stated to stop promoting hate; and stop converting the innocent feelings of the artist into something else.Check out Jagdeep Sidhu’s post here: AP Dhillon who usually stays away from social media negativity also came in support of Shubh and wrote a beautiful story for him. He said public figures are being used as chess pieces for promoting agendas, and thus, as an artist, it becomes difficult to focus on the craft.Here’s AP Dhillon’s post:',\n",
       " 'HANGZHOU: In a major development on Friday, India\\'s Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports, Anurag Thakur, cancelled his scheduled visit to the Asian Games here in protest of the \"differential treatment\" meted out to three wushu athletes, who faced visa and accreditation issues that has prevented them from travelling to China to participate in the continental showpiece.Three female wushu players from Arunachal Pradesh -- Nyeman Wangsu, Onilu Tega and Mepung Lamgu -- were not able to fly out with other members of the contingent that arrived in Hangzhou on Thursday morning. The trio faced issues in getting their accreditation validated and were reportedly issued stapled visas.The accreditation card acts as the visa for accredited athletes and personnel in order to travel to China for the Asian Games. The Government of India on Friday took a stern note of the development and reacted strongly in response, calling it a \"deliberate and selective obstruction\".Arindam Bagchi, the official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, said in a statement on microblogging website \\'X\\' (formerly Twitter), - \"The Government of India has learnt that the Chinese authorities have, in a targeted and premeditated manner, discriminated against some of the Indian sportspersons from the state of Arunachal Pradesh by denying them accreditation and entry to the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.\"In line with our longstanding and consistent position, India firmly rejects differential treatment of Indian citizens on the basis of domicile or ethnicity. Arunachal Pradesh was, is and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India.\"A strong protest has been lodged in New Delhi and Beijing against China\\'s deliberate and selective obstruction of some of our sportspersons. China\\'s action violates both the spirit of the Asian Games and the rules governing their conduct, which explicitly prohibits discrimination against competitors from member states.The statement added that Sports Minister Anurag Thakur will now not travel to China.\"Further, as a mark of our protest against the Chinese action, the Minister of Information and Broadcasting and Youth Affairs and Sports of India has cancelled his scheduled visit to China for the Games. The Government of India reserves the right to take suitable measures to safeguard our interests.\"Hours before this development in India, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and the Hangzhou Asian Games Organising Committee (HAGOC) were questioned about the issue at a press conference at the Games\\' Main Media Centre. Replying to the question, OCA\\'s honorary life vice-president Wei Jizhong claimed that the athletes were granted Chinese visas but that they \"did not accept\" it.\"China didn\\'t refuse any visa but the problem is that according to Chinese government regulations, we have the right to give them different kinds of visas. We have an arrival visa, a paper visa, visa on the passport,\" said Jizhong, who had the acting OCA president, Randhir Singh, sitting beside him.\"I am making it very clear. The Chinese government, that means the embassy, gave them (wushu athletes) visas. They can enter China, but unfortunately these athletes didn\\'t accept this visa.

       " 'The happy faces all-round – racers, organisers, the crew and the enthusiasts wishing to take in the spectacle of high-speed two-wheel action – and resounding appreciation of the Buddh International Circuit (BIC) firmly put to rest innuendos of India not being able to pull off an event – MotoGP Bharat’s inaugural edition – of this magnitude.The MotoGP Bharat weekend is from September 22-24. More on it here.Aprilia superstar Alex Espargaro, nicknamed ‘The Captain’ by his team, summed up the mood: “Maybe we were too hard on the Indian Grand Prix organisers. The track is certainly challenging but very good. Turns three and four will be tricky because of the run-off areas being short but nothing we can’t handle being the best riders in the world.”Ace MotoGP pen pusher, historian and author Mat Oxley had described motorcycle racing as “the entertainment branch of physics”. From 9am on Friday, once practice starts, we will be seeing this theory being put into practice. Pecco Bagnaia, the reigning MotoGP world champion, was fulsome in his praise for the circuit layout, saying the BIC is unlike any other circuit he had raced on and yet seemed very pleasing with the longish back straight and not just challenging corners but also elevation changes entering and exiting them.Jorge Martin, his fellow Desmosedici rider for Pramac Ducati, liked the circuit so much that instead of going around it in the traditional walkabout, he did two laps on his bicycle to strategise how he would be attacking the corners over the next three days. “It is wonderful and I love it,” he said of the track.Termed the ‘Martinator’ for his scorching pace and impeccable race craft, Jorge was in the swing of things and if he hadn’t broken the BIC lap record for a rider on a bicycle, he surely was the toast of the MotoGP aces in shaking a leg to the blockbuster “Naatu Naatu”.South African racer Brad Binder (nickname Bradical for his lightning quick starts) and his Aussie team-mate Jack Miller (nickname Thriller Miller) felt right at home and pronounced themselves “happy” with the circuit, having taken a walk around it and sussed out their lines.“I love the way the corners have that subtle banking plus you can see them from far, and especially the parabola followed by the next set of corners which could play to our strengths,” Binder said. What he left unsaid was that he is absolutely salivating at the slightly above 1km back straight that could play to his banzai strengths and the speed and braking ability of his KTM RC16.“It is as good or tough as many circuits we already race on and some with even shorter run-off areas, so we need to know as riders how to work that throttle,” said Thriller Miller.And working the throttle they did admirably while trying their hand at an impromptu game of cricket with former India cricketer Suresh Raina bowling to them both (and getting thrashed around the park!) Don’t forget both Binder and Miller come from cricket crazy nations as well. Simon Crafar, former Grand Prix winner and MotoGP’s tech commentator, probably described the circuit best in a conversation with me. “I have ridden around some of the most well-known and super serious circuits around the world, like Portimao in Portugal, Suzuka in Japan, Monza and Mugello in Italy, and I can say BIC is fast and has sections from all of the above nicely flowing into one another for the most part. It also has some sections which are stop and go. It will take some learning but once the big boys pin it, they will be beaming from ear to ear.” He was also effusive in his praise for the hospitality the MotoGP racers and crew had received, saying it is something BIC and India could be proud of.Alex Marquez, brother of eight-time World Champion Marc Marquez, was forthright in saying he had given the circuit a big thumbs up. “I can’t wait to start lapping the circuit on Friday in Free Practice 1 on my Gresini Team Ducati Desmosedici and I am sure we can make a good performance. I like the circuit as it plays to the Ducati’s strengths in terms of straight-line speed, good turning and braking abilities and it is going to be a very open session for all of us.” The irrepressible Marc, who landed early morning in Delhi on Thursday (September 21), said he was looking forward to the circuit even though he wasn’t confident about his chances given the recalcitrant nature of his Repsol Honda RC213V. “The bike is more or less the same as we have had for a majority of this year and what we are searching for is not an increment of one-tenth of a second to close the gap but about six to seven-tenths of a second per lap to be competitive against the Ducatis, Aprilias and KTMs. My coming late doesn’t mean anything and I am gung-ho about going racing in a country which has the world’s largest motorcycle market and also population!” he said. Team Yamaha riders Fabio Quartararo and Franky Morbidelli have been outgunned by the European bikes and didn’t see the script changing. In their quest for extracting more power from the inline four-cylinder engine they use (in comparison all other teams use a vee-four engine configuration), their power delivery has made the bikes more peaky and knocked the sweet handling and high cornering speed ability of their bikes. “We will of course try our best but know that the odds are stacked against us,” said Quartaro, the 2021 World MotoGP Champion. The weather was a talking point – “hot and muggy, something to watch out for”. MotoGP Bharat is the first of five flyaway races (away from the sport’s traditional European base). But later in the day, it rained. Just the right way to cool things before the riders set a torrid pace on the circuit from Friday.The writer is India’s pioneer automotive journalist, historian and author',\n",

Simultaneously, he showed his versatility by associating with the legendary director Hrishikesh Mukherjee, working in classics like ‘Abhimaan’, ‘Chupke Chupke’, ‘Anand’, and ‘Namak Haram’. This collaboration enriched Bachchan\\'s repertoire, taking him beyond the emblematic \\'angry young man\\' image that remains imprinted in public memory even today. However, the road to stardom wasn\\'t without its challenges for Amitabh Bachchan. One such intriguing tale from his early years highlights the unique hurdles he faced. The megastar recently reminisced about an episode during the shooting of the 1971 film, \\'Anand\\', where he was berated by the director, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, and the director of photography (DOP) for having \"exceptionally red lips.\" Bachchan took to his personal blog to share an image from the film \\'Anand\\' and playfully wrote about a fan complimenting his lips. He used the opportunity to narrate the backstory of that image. Apparently, when he appeared on set, the film\\'s director and DOP would often exclaim, \"Why have you applied lipstick? Wipe it off immediately!\" To their disbelief, Bachchan clarified that his lips were naturally that red. Even the makeup artist, after attempting to remove any trace of lipstick, confirmed Bachchan\\'s claim. Left with no other choice, the director and DOP then decided to tone down the brightness of his lips by applying base makeup to them. In his blog, Amitabh Bachchan humorously elaborated that what fans see in his pictures from that era is not lipstick but the base makeup used to dull the natural vibrancy of his lips. After enduring over half a century of ups and downs in the film industry, his lips, he noted, might have lost their natural brightness but continue to draw attention. In his concluding words, Bachchan humorously remarked, \"So, despite the \\'lipstick\\' controversies, if my lips still capture attention after 53 years, what more could I ask for?\" The anecdote gives a fascinating glimpse into the challenges and unexpected incidents that even legends like Amitabh Bachchan faced during their illustrious careers.',\n",

       " 'Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged there was a potential link between Indian and the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Khalistani separatist leader, at British Columbia in June. The startling accusation was followed by the Canadian foreign minister stating that their government had expelled a high-ranking Indian diplomat over the killing. India rejected Canada’s claim over the killing calling it absurd, and gave the north American country a taste of its own medicine by expelling a top Canadian diplomat in India.Canada provoked India with a fresh set of travel advisory asking its citizens to exercise high degree of caution. India again responded asking Indian nationals and students in Canada to exercise extreme caution due to deteriorating security scenario.Earlier at the G20 summit, Trudeau and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a tense meeting and Modi accused Canada of not doing enough to quell anti-India activities of extremist elements, referring to the rise of the Sikh separatist movement on Canadian soil.Nijjar was involved in several terrorist activities and targeted killings in Punjab. He was associated with Gurudwara politics in Canada that were often violent. He had links with gangster Arshdeep Singh. Nijjar was also friendly with Dal Khalsa leader Gajinder Singh, one of the five hijackers of an Indian Airlines flight in 1981. Gajinder Singh is currently in Pakistan. Last year, India’s National Investigation Agency had declared a cash reward of Rs 10 lakh for Nijjar.How will the worsening diplomatic relations impact Indians on work permit in Canada?Most students who go from India after their completing studies, especially from Punjab, get work permits for extended stay. During this time, they have to ensure sponsorship from their employers. At present, they are worried that if ties between the two countries worsen, they may not get sponsorship and work permit. They may have to leave Canada.The students also face the fear of being labeled anti-Canada. They may be targeted for “creating trouble”. It has added to their anxiety.Indian applicants queued up for permanent residence in Canada, also must be apprehensive that their cases may get delayed.India and Canada have had a love-hate relationship for over 100 years. Is the standoff likely to end amicably?That incident occurred way back in 1914 when the Komagata Maru ship carrying 376 Indian citizens, all from Punjab, were not allowed to disembark at Vancouver. Only 30 were allowed to stay, rest were sent back because of stringent Canadian immigration laws. The ship was returned to Calcutta.The police in India arrested some leaders of that ship, led by Gurdit Singh Sandhu. Later he was known as Gurdit Singh Komagata Maru. It led to a scuffle, and subsequently a riot in which police fired at the Indian passengers. Over 20 were killed.It took Canada 109 years to apologise for that. The Canadian Parliament apologised in 2016, when Justin Trudeau was the Prime Minister.But that incident cannot be compared with today’s situation. It happened a long time back. At that time, it was about Indian immigrants. Now, it’s about a Canadian citizen who was wanted for terror crimes in India.Thirty per cent of all the Sikhs in Canada are Canadian citizens by birth. Why is the number so high?The first recorded incident of a Sikh landing in Canada was 1897. British soldier Resaldar Major Kesar Singh went there and subsequently, by 1902, a few more reached British Columbia. They took up jobs in mining and lumberjacking. Ultimately, they became prosperous because they got good money for their hard labour. Then they made Canada their place of residence. Many of them were told to leave Canada because of the then Canadian immigration laws, but ultimately the community started growing there. In the 1950s, the shift started from British Columbia towards Ontario. In the 1960s and 70s, more immigrants started going to Ontario, and many of them were well educated professionals — doctors, engineers and lawyers. Another thrust came in the 1990s, when a lot of professionals from Punjab migrated for want of better opportunities in Punjab due to the peak of militancy. The trend continues till today. What was the reason for the 2017 diplomatic standoff between then Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and Canadian defence minister Harjit Singh Sajjan?When Sajjan visited India in 2017, Captain Amarinder Singh refused to meet him alleging that he was a Khalistan supporter. He said that Sajjan’s father, Sundar Singh, was a member of the World Sikh Organization which was involved in alleged anti-India or pro-Khalistan activities.When Trudeau came to India in 2018, he wanted to visit Amritsar. He placed a request, but the Ministry of External Affairs told him to take it up with Captain Amarinder Singh. The then chief minister was unhappy that a list of 10 designated terrorists had been given to Canada, yet the Canadian government had not acted.Later, the tension was diffused, and they met at a hotel in Amritsar where Singh conveyed his fears and apprehensions to Trudeau.Audio production: Prateek Kapoor',\n",

       " 'LUCKNOW: BJP national general secretary, Sunil Bansal, said on Friday that his party will come up with a “special plan” for the 14 Lok Sabha seats they were unable to win in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Bansal made this announcement while reviewing the BJP\\'s election preparations in the Mainpuri, Ambedkarnagar, Shrawasti, Lalganj, and Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituencies. Rae Bareli is currently represented by senior Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav\\'s wife, Dimple Yadav, is the MP from Mainpuri. Similarly, Shrawasti, Lalganj, and Ambedkarnagar are held by the BSP.Former UP BJP general secretary (organisation), Bansal, played a pivotal role as one of the key poll strategists for the saffron outfit that achieved a significant victory in the 2017 assembly elections. He is currently responsible for Telangana, Odisha, and West Bengal and also oversees the Lok Sabha seats in UP that the BJP failed to win in 2019.“Work has to be done by making strategy at the booth level. More and more people need to be covered under PM Vishwakarma Yojana and Ayushman scheme (envisaging free medical treatment up to Rs 5 lakh).” He made these remarks during a meeting chaired by UP BJP chief Bhupendra Chaudhary and attended by state general secretary (organization) Dharam Pal Singh, as well as several other senior leaders.The meeting also included BJP Vistaraks (full-time BJP workers deployed to provide independent feedback).Bansal categorically underscored the need of taking government policies to the grass root level by establishing contact and communication with youth, farmers, women and beneficiaries at the booth level. He said that “micromanagement” and “teamwork at the booth level” will hold the key for BJP to achieve the target of winning all 80 Lok Sabha in UP. He also stressed on the importance of establishing communication with senior party workers.Chaudhary pointed out that despite the opposition (SP, BSP, and RLD) forming an alliance, the BJP managed to secure over 50% of the votes in 2019. He maintained that the political environment was favorable for the BJP under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. He also stated that the BJP had fulfilled all the promises made to the people in its election manifestos, saying, \"BJP does what it says, and this mindset makes the party omnipresent.\"Dharampal Singh said that a strong booth structure was the key `mantra’ that will bring victory for the BJP in 2024. He stressed the importance of contact, communication and coordination for successful implementation of action plans.Singh said that \\'Booth Sashaktikaran Abhiyan\\' is preparing a blueprint for a definite victory in 2024. He said that programmes will be organised at the booth level on the birth anniversary of Jan Sangh leader Deen Dayal Upadhyay on September 25.',\n",

We hope that they engage with us so that we can get to the bottom of this very serious matter.\"Earlier this week, tensions flared between India and Canada following Trudeau\\'s allegations of the potential involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia on June 18. India had designated Nijjar as a terrorist in 2020. India rejected the allegations as \\'absurd\\' and \\'motivated\\', and expelled a senior Canadian diplomat in a tit-for-tat move to Ottawa\\'s expulsion of an Indian official over the case.While Canada hasn\\'t yet provided any public evidence to back its claims, AP report said citing Canadian government sources that Ottawa\\'s allegations are based on both human and signals intelligence and inputs from an ally, the Five Eye network, an intelligence alliance consisting of the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.US says it expects India to work with CanadaUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the United States wanted to see accountability over the killing. \"We are deeply concerned about the allegations that Prime Minister Trudeau has raised,\" Blinken told reporters in a press briefing.

That last visit overlapped with a tense meeting between Prime Minister Trudeau and Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, it said.\"Canadian sources say that when pressed behind closed doors, no Indian official has denied the bombshell allegation at the core of this case — that there is evidence to suggest Indian government involvement in the assassination of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil,\" it added.Canada is weighing retaliation but has taken no decision yet, said government sources in Ottawa.On Thursday, India asked Canada to come down hard on terrorists and anti-India elements operating from its soil and suspended visa services for Canadians, as escalating tensions between the two nations over the killing of Nijjar pushed their ties to an all-time low.India also asked Canada to downsize its diplomatic staff in the country, arguing that there should be parity in strength and rank equivalence in the mutual diplomatic presence. The size of Canadian diplomatic staff in India is larger than what New Delhi has in Canada.When asked about the intelligence reports, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said she couldn\\'t comment without risking the investigation and Canada\\'s obligations to its Five Eyes partners.\"That partnership rests very much on those… intelligence conversations being held in confidence,\" she told CBC News Network.Asked if Canada is thinking about retaliating by pausing visa processing for Indian visitors, Freeland said the government is focused on bringing the killers to justice.\"This is not about geopolitics. This is about Canada and the safety of Canadians in Canada. This is about the rule of law,\" she said.Prime Minister Trudeau Thursday said Canada is not looking to \"provoke or cause problems\" with India as he urged New Delhi to take the matter \"extremely seriously\" and work with Ottawa to \"uncover the truth\".\"We call upon the government of India to take seriously this matter and to work with us to shed full transparency and ensure accountability and justice in this matter,\" Trudeau said while responding to questions on the diplomatic row between India and Canada.\"We are a country of the rule of law. We are going to continue to do the work necessary to keep Canadians safe and to uphold our values and the international rules-based order. That\\'s our focus right now,\" added Trudeau, who is here to attend the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.When asked whether his government would take any retaliatory measures following India\\'s suspension of visa services for Canadians, Trudeau said that his government was not looking to provoke or cause problems.The Canadian government has not released its evidence and has suggested it could emerge during an eventual legal process, the CBC report said.The US on Thursday said it supports Canada\\'s efforts to investigate allegations of India\\'s involvement in the killing of Nijjar, observing that no country can get any \"special exemption\" for such kind of activities.The US government has not confirmed or denied that it was the Five Eyes ally providing some of the signals intelligence.But National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters at a White House news conference that the United States has been in frequent contact with Canada on this issue.“I\\'m not going to get into the substance of private diplomatic conversations, but we are in constant contact with our Canadian counterparts. We are consulting with them closely. We support the efforts that they are undertaking in this investigation and we have also been in touch with the Indian government as well,” he said.\"We have deep concerns about the allegations and we would like to see this investigation carried forward and the perpetrators held to account. That is what the US has stood for from the moment this emerged in public and we will continue to stand for that until this fully plays its way out,” he said.Refusing to respond to questions on the evidence of Canadian allegations, Sullivan said he is not going to speak to either intelligence or law enforcement matters from this podium.“I will let that process play out. We are in, as I said before, continuous communication and consultation with the Canadian government and we will remain so as we go forward,” he said.',\n",

       " \"Vidya Balan adapted a rather bold avatar for ‘The Dirty Picture’ and her portrayal of Silk Smitha brought in a lot of appreciation from across the country. She was soon labeled as ‘sexy’, and the actress was not exactly happy about it. Speaking to Filmfare, the actress opened up about body positivity and how things changed after ‘The Dirty Picture’. “It happened over time. I was called sexy after I did The Dirty Picture. And the huge commercial success got me so much love. It even got me a National Award. I was being called the female hero and all that. Basically, I was not being Vidya. I was Silk. I was playing a character, and I was okay with it. I am far more comfortable being a character than being myself in public. When I am promoting the film, I have fun because I am promoting a character. The moment you make it about me, it makes me a little uncomfortable. So I had just done it without thinking. That translated to me being sexy. And I hadn’t been called sexy until then. Suddenly, there was a new me.” Recalling how she has embraced her body type, Vidya added, “I had also met Siddharth at that time. He made me feel great. I started accepting my body because of a combination of factors. But the journey had its ups and downs. What happens is that when acceptance comes and you are new to it, you get scared that you will be found out. It’s a kind of imposter syndrome. I’ve gotten over that, and I’m slowly accepting myself the way I am.”Directed by Milan Luthria, 'The Dirty Picture' released in 2011 and was a huge commercial success.\",\n",
       " 'SRINAGAR: Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was released from house arrest on Friday, more than four years after he had been detained in the wake of Article 370’s abrogation. He led the prayers at Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid where he called for the Kashmir issue to be resolved through talks. “We have always invited our Pandit brothers to return to the Valley,” he said.Mirwaiz, put under house arrest on eve of Article 370 repeal, finally releasedMore than four years after being detained in the wake of Article 370’s abrogation, Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was released from house arrest on Friday and soon after led the prayers at Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid where he called for the Kashmir issue to be resolved through dialogue.Leading the prayers as Kashmir’s top clergyman that gives him the Mirwaiz title, he lamented that despite advocating peace, it was unfortunate that he was branded “anti-national, anti-peace and separatist”.Holding fort at his usual pulpit for the first time since he was put in detention on August 4, 2019 -- a day ahead of Article 370’s scrapping -- the Mirwaiz pushed for the return of Pandits. “We have always invited our Pandit brothers to return to the Valley,” he said, often turning emotional and teary-eyed during his address.The Mirwaiz pointed out that Kashmir might be a territorial question for many but for the people of the region, it was “foremost a humanitarian issue” to be addressed through talks. According to him, Hurriyat believes “JK’s one part is in India while the rest two are in Pakistan and China, and by merging them fully, JK will be complete, as it was on August 14, 1947”.The Hurriyat chief referred to PM Narendra Modi’s statement on the Ukraine conflict that “this is not an era of war”, arguing the sentiment holds true in the context of Kashmir, too. “We have always believed and participated in efforts of resolution through an alternative to violent means, which is dialogue and reconciliation. We have personally suffered for pursuing this route,” he said. After August 5, 2019, people have faced difficult times as JK’s “special identity was snatched and was bifurcated in two UTs”, the Mirwaiz said, describing his detention as the “most difficult phase” of his life after his father’s death. “I was forced to move courts and was informed yesterday by senior officers that I will be released.”The Mirwaiz had on September 15 moved the Jammu and Kashmir high court, which had sought the government’s response in four weeks.Asserting that he had “the responsibility to raise the voice for the people” as the Mirwaiz, the Hurriyat chief called for release of all political prisoners, journalists, lawyers, civil society members and youths. “I want to tell my people to be patient, to keep faith in the almighty,” he said, signing off by urging the gathering to leave the mosque “peacefully”.The request was kept, with divisional commissioner Vijay Kumar Bidhuri confirming the congregation concluded peacefully. “The credit goes to the people and (security) agencies, who took the decision after calculating things,” Bidhuri said. The allusion possibly was to releasing the Mirwaiz and allowing him to lead the prayer meet.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: Wushu athlete Mepung Lamgu has gone incommunicado since being denied visa to travel to China for the Asian Games, leaving her family members in Arunachal Pradesh worried and clinging to hope that she wouldn\\'t take any \"extreme step\".The 20-year-old is one of the three wushu players from Arunachal Pradesh who were denied visas to travel to China for the Hangzhou Asian Games.She was \"crying inconsolably\" when her brother Gandhi Lamgu, a doctor in Itanagar, last spoke to her just after the news broke on Thursday. He hasn\\'t been able to contact her since that conversation.\"Now she\\'s not even taking our calls, and it\\'s coming switched off. So we are also very worried about her, kahin kuch kar na de ro ro ke (hope she doesn\\'t take any extreme step as she is crying inconsolably),\" Gandhi told PTI from Itanagar.He has not even shared this development with their parents as they would be worried back home in Seppa, a remote place about 200 kilometres from the state capital.\"I\\'m also in a difficult phase of my career, I can\\'t even take leave and I am also not financially sound. So dad would be worried and I have not told them. The phone network coverage is also poor there. I didn\\'t want to disturb them emotionally,\" he lamented.It was Gandhi, who ensured that Mepung pursued her dream in wushu.Mepung, who competes in wushu taolu-taijijian and taijiquan events, along with two other female wushu players from Arunachal Pradesh -- Nyeman Wangsu and Onilu Tega -- were denied accreditation, which also works as visa, for the Asian Games that officially gets underway on Saturday.The trio were scheduled to fly out of India on Friday night with eight other members of the wushu contingent but were forced to stay back without proper clearance as their accreditation could not be downloaded.This was not the first time the Arunachal athletes faced such an issue for an event in China.India had pulled out of the World University Games in Chengdu in July in response to stapled visas being issued to athletes from India\\'s northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh.\"When I spoke to her last she was crying like hell yesterday. Then we had exchanged few words on WhatsApp.\"She\\'s really drained emotionally, not talking to anyone in the family. I just told her we can only try. Being an elder brother, I tried my best to make her understand the reality but she\\'s too young.\"We are trying our best but we are helpless. I\\'m sure there will be many more opportunities ahead in future. I just told her this.\"This has not happened for the first time. We have been facing the same issue. But our reach is not that far.\"Daughter of a police constable, Mepung has six siblings including her eldest brother Gandhi.\"When she was in class six, she was really meritorious but she was very keen on becoming a sports person and become a wushu athlete.\"So, as a responsible brother, my dad and I decided that she should follow her dream and put her in our renowned sports school Sangeladin Sports School, got enrolled in class six. She has not stopped since then.\"Mepung made her first mark as a junior by winning a bronze in the International Wushu Championship in Georgia in 2016.She then went on to win two gold medals in Moscow Wushu Star 2022, and this year she won a bronze in the same meet at Moscow.She also shone at the Gujarat National Games, returning with a gold medal and then visited her hometown in Seppa.',\n",

Gambhir believes that if Rohit Sharma\\'s side aims to clinch the coveted trophy, the clash against Australia will be the most pivotal game of their campaign.India, the champions of 1983 and 2011, will commence their quest in the 13th edition of the Men\\'s ODI World Cup with a showdown against the five-time champions, Australia, on October 8 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. This tournament marks the first time India is solely hosting the Men\\'s ODI World Cup. \"Look, I have always said this, and there is no doubt in this, that if you want to win the World Cup, then you have to beat Australia. In 2007 when we won the World Cup, we defeated Australia in the semifinal. In 2011 when we won the World Cup, we beat Australia in the quarterfinal,\" Gambhir said to Star Sports. \"Australia is the strongest team in any ICC tournament. Remove the ranking, ranking does not matter. You can be in any position in the rankings, but Australia, when it comes to those big tournaments, the World Cups, I think Australia has got the players, they have got the self-belief, Australia has the ability to play those big moments really well.\"Gambhir highlighted the historical significance of facing Australia in crucial stages of World Cup campaigns, saying, \"And you can see this, the three World Cups that India won, we had to beat Australia in the knockout stage two times. And the World Cups that we have lost, in 2015 we lost to Australia. So I believe that if we have to win the World Cup this year, Australia is going to be the most important game, and we start against Australia, so there is nothing better than that. So beating Australia is very, very important.\"On the other hand, Shane Watson, a former member of Australia\\'s World Cup-winning teams in 2007 and 2015, envisions a tantalising prospect of an India-Australia final in the 2023 edition of the competition. Watson expressed his support for the Pat Cummins-led Australian side, expecting them to rise to the occasion in crucial league-stage matches.\"Definitely going to back Australia with the calibre of players they have. They have got a few question marks going into this World Cup, for sure, with a few positions and some injuries they have had, but the players they have got, they certainly know how to step up in these big games,\" Watson said.\"And India, being at home, they\\'d know the conditions better than anyone, their bowlers are obviously on fire at the moment, with their quicks and also Kuldeep Yadav who is only getting better and better. So India with their firepower, especially with their top order in particular, they certainly can go all the way.

I\\'m used to it, I love it,\" Rahul said about leading the side in place of regular skipper Rohit Sharma.\"I think the intensity in the afternoon was great, after Colombo this felt like heaven at the start but it was really hot and humid.

But managed to build a good partnership with Surya, need to put myself in such challenging situations.\"We kept talking about hitting good cricket shots, rotating the strike and this is something all our batters are working on. We didn\\'t want to get bogged down, we were always on par so we wanted to take it deep,\" he said.Man-of-the-match Mohammed Shami, who returned with brilliant 5 for 51, felt good after bowling his full quota of 10 overs on Friday in hot and humid conditions.\"It depends on the captain and the game situation, but despite the heat you feel like bowling 4-5 overs with the new ball,\" Shami said of bowling longer spells in the sultry conditions.\"I enjoyed the wicket of Marsh, that\\'s a different feeling when you get the outside edge, when you control your swing nicely. It was important to hit the right lengths on this wicket, either at full pace or go slow, but bowling the right lengths were key,\" he said.Australia captain Pat Cummins said it was not an overall performance from his injury-ridden side but hoped the series would help them to build a good rhythm in the run-up to the ODI World Cup starting in India next month.\"Personally, happy to be back. Good to get my first game in India. A few guys batted well, few guys bowled well but overall not good enough.\"(On injuries) They\\'d probably not be ready for the second game, maybe the third game.

       " 'DEHRADUN: Geological Survey of India (GSI) and National Institute of Hydrology (NIH), two premier central institutions tasked to study subsidence in Joshimath, in their report submitted to the government, appeared to have given a \\'clean chit\\' to the NTPC\\'s 520 MW Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project on the Alaknanda river in Chamoli district. On January 5, following widespread protests by local residents, the state government had stopped all works at the NTPC project site.Roorkee-based NIH, an organisation under Union Jal Shakti ministry, in its report submitted to Uttarakhand State Disaster Management Authority, has claimed that \"gushing waters at Jaypee Colony in Joshimath town had no connection with the hydel project.\" Local residents led by citizens\\' group, Joshimath Bachao Sangharsh Samiti (JBSS) and some experts had been claiming that the Joshimath disaster was the result of the NTPC puncturing aquifers with their tunnel-boring machines. However, NIH, in its report, a copy of which is with TOI, claimed otherwise. Quoting results of isotopic analysis of water samples, the report stated, \"The isotopic analysis suggested that the origin of the gush water in Jaypee Colony is from upper reaches (Sunil forest and Auli area). The water sample taken from NTPC sites differed from the water seeping through the aquifer at Jaypee.\" Speaking about the possible causes behind the burst of the aquifer at Jaypee, the NIH report went on to add, \"There may be a possibility that some temporary storage was created due to the blockage of any sub-surface channel, which eventually burst from the weak point when the hydrostatic pressure of stored water exceeded the soil-water bearing capacity of the area.\" The problem of subsidence in Joshimath had suddenly aggravated early this year, after a fresh aquifer burst on the night of January 2 with major turbid water flow. The experts of GSI also studied the blast-induced damages and possibility of the seepage from the hydel project\\'s \\'head race tunnel\\'. \"Prima facie, the very question of any blast-induced damages attributing to the current situation in Joshimath is unlikely as the alignment of HRT is located at a lateral distance of 1.1km from the urban sprawl of Joshimath. This stretch is excavated through tunnel boring machine, which is a non-destructive method of tunnelling without blasting,\" GSI said.',\n",

The trio faced issues in getting their accreditation validated and were reportedly issued stapled visas.The accreditation card acts as the visa for accredited athletes and personnel in order to travel to China for the Asian Games. The Government of India on Friday took a stern note of the development and reacted strongly in response, calling it a \"deliberate and selective obstruction\".Arindam Bagchi, the official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, said in a statement on microblogging website \\'X\\' (formerly Twitter), - \"The Government of India has learnt that the Chinese authorities have, in a targeted and premeditated manner, discriminated against some of the Indian sportspersons from the state of Arunachal Pradesh by denying them accreditation and entry to the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.\"In line with our longstanding and consistent position, India firmly rejects differential treatment of Indian citizens on the basis of domicile or ethnicity.

This Ekadashi holds a great religious and spiritual significance. Devotees observe fast with great devotion and dedication. It is believed that Lord Vishnu shifts his sleeping position from left to right side on this auspicious day and that's why it is known as Parsva Parivartini Ekadashi. In some regions, Vamana Avtar of Lord Vishnu is worshipped on this day. Devotees who offer prayers to Lord Vishnu on this sacred day, get blessed with all the worldly pleasures and happiness. It is also believed that people can get rid of their bad Karmas, they can get relieved from the cycle of birth and death and get salvation.Parivartini Ekadashi 2023: StoryThe fasting story of Parivartini Ekadashi was narrated by Lord Krishna to Arjuna. According to the legend, a demon named King Bali used to rule in the Treta Yuga. Despite being a demon, he was very charitable and truthful and served the people of the kingdom with great dedication. Due to the impact of his devotion and good governance, King Bali also started ruling in heaven by replacing Devraj Indra. Devraj Indra and all the other gods got scared of King Bali. Therefore, all the deities prayed to Lord Vishnu for protection against him. Lord Vishnu took the Vamana avatar in order to protect the Gods and went to King Bali. There he requested King Bali to donate three steps of land to him. King Bali accepted this request of Vamana. As soon as King Bali accepted his request, the Vamana avatar of Shri Vishnu assumed the form of a giant and measured the three worlds in two steps. When there was no vacancy for the third step, King Bali bowed his head with folded hands in front of Vamana and asked to keep the third step on his head. Lord Vishnu was very pleased with the kindness and devotion of King Bali and therefore made King Bali the Lord of Hell. Since then the fast of Parivartini Ekadashi is observed by the devotees. On this Ekadashi, a sleeping idol of Lord Vishnu is always kept with King Bali in Hell. This day is also observed as Vamana Jayanti.Parivartini Ekadashi 2023: Puja Rituals 1. Wake up early in the morning and take a bath before commencing the fast rituals.2. Devotees who observe fast on Ekadashi, do not take bath with soap or any other body wash. 3. Place an idol of Lord Vishnu and Shree Yantra (form of Goddess Laxmi), Light a diya with desi ghee, offer flowers and put tilak with chandan and kumkum. 4. Offer home made sweets to Lord Vishnu and Panchamrit (mixture of Milk, Curd, Honey, Sugar and Ghee) and do not forget to put Tulsi Patra in each offerings.5. Tulsi Patra is Lord Vishnu's favourite herb so without offering Tulsi Patra, Pooja is considered incomplete.6. Recite Ekadashi Vrat Katha, Vishnu Sahastranaam and chant Lord Vishnu Aarti.7. New fast observers must note that eating rice on Ekadashi day is prohibited.8. The fast can be broken on Dwadashi Tithi but who are unable to observe fast can break their fast by having satvik food items such as - fried potato, sabudana kheer or tikki, fruits and milk products.Mantra1.

On January 5, following widespread protests by local residents, the state government had stopped all works at the NTPC project site.Roorkee-based NIH, an organisation under Union Jal Shakti ministry, in its report submitted to Uttarakhand State Disaster Management Authority, has claimed that \"gushing waters at Jaypee Colony in Joshimath town had no connection with the hydel project.\" Local residents led by citizens\\' group, Joshimath Bachao Sangharsh Samiti (JBSS) and some experts had been claiming that the Joshimath disaster was the result of the NTPC puncturing aquifers with their tunnel-boring machines. However, NIH, in its report, a copy of which is with TOI, claimed otherwise. Quoting results of isotopic analysis of water samples, the report stated, \"The isotopic analysis suggested that the origin of the gush water in Jaypee Colony is from upper reaches (Sunil forest and Auli area). The water sample taken from NTPC sites differed from the water seeping through the aquifer at Jaypee.\" Speaking about the possible causes behind the burst of the aquifer at Jaypee, the NIH report went on to add, \"There may be a possibility that some temporary storage was created due to the blockage of any sub-surface channel, which eventually burst from the weak point when the hydrostatic pressure of stored water exceeded the soil-water bearing capacity of the area.\" The problem of subsidence in Joshimath had suddenly aggravated early this year, after a fresh aquifer burst on the night of January 2 with major turbid water flow. The experts of GSI also studied the blast-induced damages and possibility of the seepage from the hydel project\\'s \\'head race tunnel\\'. \"Prima facie, the very question of any blast-induced damages attributing to the current situation in Joshimath is unlikely as the alignment of HRT is located at a lateral distance of 1.1km from the urban sprawl of Joshimath.

Government functionaries were discussing the worrisome possibility in light of claims made by authorities in Ottawa to the Canadian media, that PM Justin Trudeau\\'s allegation of \"credible evidence\" of India\\'s \"potential link\" to the killing of pro-Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar was based on intelligence on communications involving India\\'s diplomatic personnel.Intel officials mock idea that Indian diplomats were part of plot to killWhile India did not respond to the allegations, intelligence sources said the claim deserved a deeper probe to ascertain if unauthorised equipment was used by local law enforcement to put Indian high commission officials under illegal surveillance.The development, coupled with the disclosure of Nijjar\\'s family that the terrorist used to meet with Canadian security intelligence service officers every week, has added another element of intrigue to the confrontation Trudeau has set off. Officials, however, said as tapping the mobile phones of diplomats would be against the Vienna Convention, advanced surveillance equipment like \\'off the air\\' or devices like cell-site simulators and IMSI catchers may have been used to tap in on the conversations, if at all. \"Trojans, which require zero-click or one-click for activation on the user\\'s end, are also used in such covert snooping by computers so as to take control of the target device,\" a security expert explained.Authorities were, in any case, perplexed by the mismatch between Trudeau\\'s allegation and his demand that India needed to cooperate on the one hand, and his reluctance to share evidence about the \"potential link\" on the other. Even as they raised the issue of illicit snooping, the intelligence officials mocked the suggestion that Indian diplomats were part of the assassination plot. \"Embassy officials, leave alone those of India which asks for and enforces complete scrupulousness by its representatives abroad, would never be involved in such tasks,\" said a senior government source.Sources in the intelligence community said the Canadian intelligence could, at most, be about some tittle tattle among Indian embassy employees in the wake of Nijjar\\'s killing, which was snooped on illegally. Officials highlighted the portion of news reports which quoted Canadian officials saying that the information was in the form of SIGINT (signal intelligence).\"This would require further elaboration to ascertain what kind of communication intelligence was tapped. It could just be the analysis of IP addresses showing a connection between point A and B or it could be actual conversations or an email.

The three were forced to skip the Games as India does not accept stapled visas, which it views as discriminatory.After registering a strong protest with the Chinese authorities in New Delhi and Beijing, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said Union sports minister Anurag Thakur had cancelled his scheduled visit to China for the Asiad and that Beijing\\'s \"action violates the spirit and rules of the Asian Games\".‘China has acted in a targeted and premeditated way’ Registering a strong protest with China over its issuing of stapled visas to three wushu players from Arunachal Pradesh, the Indian ministry of external affairs said on Friday, “Arunachal was, is and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India. China’s action violates... rules governing their conduct (of the Games), which explicitly prohibits discrimination against competitors from member-states.” The MEA added that “the Chinese authorities have, in a targeted and premeditated manner, discriminated against some of the Indian sportspersons from Arunachal Pradesh by denying them accreditation and entry to the Asian Games. In line with our long-standing and consistent position, India firmly rejects differential treatment of Indian citizens on the basis of domicile or ethnicity.” Despite protests by India, China continues to claim sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh, saying it falls in the southern Tibet region. China, which also boycotted a G20 meeting in the state, refers to Arunachal as Zangnan calling it Chinese territory. Its foreign ministry reiterated on Friday that China has never recognised “so-called Arunachal’’. The development came a day after TOI reported that three female wushu players – all hailing from Arunachal Pradesh and part of the country’s Asian Games contingent – were forced to stay back in Delhi even as other team members flew to Hangzhou for the multi-sport event after failing to receive necessary clearances from the Chinese authorities. The three players — Nyeman Wangsu, Onilu Tega and Mepung Lamgu — were part of the 11-member wushu contingent. In July, the same could not travel to Chengdu for the World University Games as they were issued stapled visas by the Chinese embassy. Before MEA’s official response, Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and Hangzhou’s Games’ Organising Committee (HAGOC) jointly held a press conference and informed that the three Indian athletes concerned were issued visas as per Chinese government’s guidelines, but they refused to accept it. “I should clarify that these Indian athletes already got visas to enter China. China didn’t refuse any visa but the problem is that according to the Chinese government regulations, we have the right to give them different kinds of visas. We have an arrival visa, a paper visa and a visa in the passport. This is the host country’s regulation. So, I am making it very clear. The Chinese government, that means the embassy at the arriving country, gave them visas. They can enter China, but unfortunately these athletes didn’t accept this (stapled) visa. I don’t think this is OCA’s problem because the Chinese government lets all the athletes who satisfy the eligibility to come and compete here,” Wei Jizhong, OCA’s hon life VP, said. Later, a source in OCA confirmed to TOI that the three players won’t be travelling to China and an eight-member wushu squad will compete. It has been learnt that Onilu and Mepung were issued E accreditation cards which they couldn’t download for the purpose of validation. In case of Nyeman, she did receive her physical accreditation card but it wasn’t valid for her entry to China, which the Indian authorities considered a deliberate act on the part of Beijing to deny her participation. At the multi-sport events like Olympics and Asiad, the accreditation acts almost like visa',\n",

We are blessed that millions gave us the opportunity to take this historic move.

       " 'SRINAGAR: Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was released from house arrest on Friday, more than four years after he had been detained in the wake of Article 370’s abrogation. He led the prayers at Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid where he called for the Kashmir issue to be resolved through talks. “We have always invited our Pandit brothers to return to the Valley,” he said.Mirwaiz, put under house arrest on eve of Article 370 repeal, finally releasedMore than four years after being detained in the wake of Article 370’s abrogation, Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was released from house arrest on Friday and soon after led the prayers at Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid where he called for the Kashmir issue to be resolved through dialogue.Leading the prayers as Kashmir’s top clergyman that gives him the Mirwaiz title, he lamented that despite advocating peace, it was unfortunate that he was branded “anti-national, anti-peace and separatist”.Holding fort at his usual pulpit for the first time since he was put in detention on August 4, 2019 -- a day ahead of Article 370’s scrapping -- the Mirwaiz pushed for the return of Pandits. “We have always invited our Pandit brothers to return to the Valley,” he said, often turning emotional and teary-eyed during his address.The Mirwaiz pointed out that Kashmir might be a territorial question for many but for the people of the region, it was “foremost a humanitarian issue” to be addressed through talks. According to him, Hurriyat believes “JK’s one part is in India while the rest two are in Pakistan and China, and by merging them fully, JK will be complete, as it was on August 14, 1947”.The Hurriyat chief referred to PM Narendra Modi’s statement on the Ukraine conflict that “this is not an era of war”, arguing the sentiment holds true in the context of Kashmir, too. “We have always believed and participated in efforts of resolution through an alternative to violent means, which is dialogue and reconciliation. We have personally suffered for pursuing this route,” he said. After August 5, 2019, people have faced difficult times as JK’s “special identity was snatched and was bifurcated in two UTs”, the Mirwaiz said, describing his detention as the “most difficult phase” of his life after his father’s death. “I was forced to move courts and was informed yesterday by senior officers that I will be released.”The Mirwaiz had on September 15 moved the Jammu and Kashmir high court, which had sought the government’s response in four weeks.Asserting that he had “the responsibility to raise the voice for the people” as the Mirwaiz, the Hurriyat chief called for release of all political prisoners, journalists, lawyers, civil society members and youths. “I want to tell my people to be patient, to keep faith in the almighty,” he said, signing off by urging the gathering to leave the mosque “peacefully”.The request was kept, with divisional commissioner Vijay Kumar Bidhuri confirming the congregation concluded peacefully. “The credit goes to the people and (security) agencies, who took the decision after calculating things,” Bidhuri said. The allusion possibly was to releasing the Mirwaiz and allowing him to lead the prayer meet.',\n",

Hate speeches were being made outside Parliament but now hate speech has been delivered on the floor of the House by a BJP MP,\" Ali said. \"I expect that the Speaker will take action on this. But if action is not taken, then with a heavy heart, I can consider quitting the membership of this House because people have not sent me to Parliament to listen to hate speeches,\" he added.Ali wrote to the Speaker demanding an investigation by the privileges committee into Bidhuri\\'s \"most foul\" comments while Congress, NCP, TMC and DMK wrote to Birla separately with the same demand. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, along with party general secretary K C Venugopal, visited Ali at his residence to express solidarity with him. Ali is said to have broken down in front of Rahul Gandhi, asking what crime had he committed to deserve this humiliation.It capped a day of high emotions, when opposition members lashed out at BJP for nurturing \"hate speech\" to the extent of defiling Parliament, and Congress demanding that the Speaker refer the matter to the privileges committee. Party spokesman Jairam Ramesh said members had been punished with suspension for non-offences like raising slogans, while Bidhuri\\'s actions were an insult to every MP and Parliament. \"The PM claims \\'sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka prayas, sabka vishwas\\'.

The party, however, asked opposition parties what action they had taken against their leaders for using abusive language against PM Narendra Modi more than 90 times. “BJP strongly condemns the use of any kind of abusive language. Taking immediate cognisance of the indecent remarks made by a BJP MP in the House, party president J P Nadda has issued a show-cause notice to the MP and asked him to reply within 10 days. Therefore, there should not be any kind of politics on this,” BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said. Soon after the incident, defence minister Rajnath Singh, who was present in the House, had expressed regret for his party MP’s remarks.Congress pulls up its MP in Chair for ‘inaction’Congress is said to have reprimanded its senior Kerala MP Kodikunnil Suresh for “inaction” as the presiding officer in Lok Sabha when Ramesh Bidhuri hurled abuses at BSP’s Danish Ali. A Malayalam speaker, Suresh could not grasp what was said by the BJP MP and responded to the commotion in a perfunctory manner. Asenior Congress office-bearer is said to have spoken to him. Speaking to TOI, Suresh said he could not understand what was said in Hindi, while the English translation was very slow, and that made it impossible to comprehend the words.',\n",

The three were forced to skip the Games as India does not accept stapled visas, which it views as discriminatory.After registering a strong protest with the Chinese authorities in New Delhi and Beijing, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said Union sports minister Anurag Thakur had cancelled his scheduled visit to China for the Asiad and that Beijing\\'s \"action violates the spirit and rules of the Asian Games\".‘China has acted in a targeted and premeditated way’ Registering a strong protest with China over its issuing of stapled visas to three wushu players from Arunachal Pradesh, the Indian ministry of external affairs said on Friday, “Arunachal was, is and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India. China’s action violates... rules governing their conduct (of the Games), which explicitly prohibits discrimination against competitors from member-states.” The MEA added that “the Chinese authorities have, in a targeted and premeditated manner, discriminated against some of the Indian sportspersons from Arunachal Pradesh by denying them accreditation and entry to the Asian Games. In line with our long-standing and consistent position, India firmly rejects differential treatment of Indian citizens on the basis of domicile or ethnicity.” Despite protests by India, China continues to claim sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh, saying it falls in the southern Tibet region. China, which also boycotted a G20 meeting in the state, refers to Arunachal as Zangnan calling it Chinese territory. Its foreign ministry reiterated on Friday that China has never recognised “so-called Arunachal’’. The development came a day after TOI reported that three female wushu players – all hailing from Arunachal Pradesh and part of the country’s Asian Games contingent – were forced to stay back in Delhi even as other team members flew to Hangzhou for the multi-sport event after failing to receive necessary clearances from the Chinese authorities. The three players — Nyeman Wangsu, Onilu Tega and Mepung Lamgu — were part of the 11-member wushu contingent. In July, the same could not travel to Chengdu for the World University Games as they were issued stapled visas by the Chinese embassy. Before MEA’s official response, Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and Hangzhou’s Games’ Organising Committee (HAGOC) jointly held a press conference and informed that the three Indian athletes concerned were issued visas as per Chinese government’s guidelines, but they refused to accept it. “I should clarify that these Indian athletes already got visas to enter China. China didn’t refuse any visa but the problem is that according to the Chinese government regulations, we have the right to give them different kinds of visas. We have an arrival visa, a paper visa and a visa in the passport. This is the host country’s regulation. So, I am making it very clear. The Chinese government, that means the embassy at the arriving country, gave them visas. They can enter China, but unfortunately these athletes didn’t accept this (stapled) visa. I don’t think this is OCA’s problem because the Chinese government lets all the athletes who satisfy the eligibility to come and compete here,” Wei Jizhong, OCA’s hon life VP, said. Later, a source in OCA confirmed to TOI that the three players won’t be travelling to China and an eight-member wushu squad will compete. It has been learnt that Onilu and Mepung were issued E accreditation cards which they couldn’t download for the purpose of validation. In case of Nyeman, she did receive her physical accreditation card but it wasn’t valid for her entry to China, which the Indian authorities considered a deliberate act on the part of Beijing to deny her participation. At the multi-sport events like Olympics and Asiad, the accreditation acts almost like visa',\n",

This Ekadashi holds a great religious and spiritual significance. Devotees observe fast with great devotion and dedication. It is believed that Lord Vishnu shifts his sleeping position from left to right side on this auspicious day and that's why it is known as Parsva Parivartini Ekadashi. In some regions, Vamana Avtar of Lord Vishnu is worshipped on this day. Devotees who offer prayers to Lord Vishnu on this sacred day, get blessed with all the worldly pleasures and happiness. It is also believed that people can get rid of their bad Karmas, they can get relieved from the cycle of birth and death and get salvation.Parivartini Ekadashi 2023: StoryThe fasting story of Parivartini Ekadashi was narrated by Lord Krishna to Arjuna. According to the legend, a demon named King Bali used to rule in the Treta Yuga. Despite being a demon, he was very charitable and truthful and served the people of the kingdom with great dedication. Due to the impact of his devotion and good governance, King Bali also started ruling in heaven by replacing Devraj Indra. Devraj Indra and all the other gods got scared of King Bali. Therefore, all the deities prayed to Lord Vishnu for protection against him. Lord Vishnu took the Vamana avatar in order to protect the Gods and went to King Bali. There he requested King Bali to donate three steps of land to him. King Bali accepted this request of Vamana. As soon as King Bali accepted his request, the Vamana avatar of Shri Vishnu assumed the form of a giant and measured the three worlds in two steps. When there was no vacancy for the third step, King Bali bowed his head with folded hands in front of Vamana and asked to keep the third step on his head. Lord Vishnu was very pleased with the kindness and devotion of King Bali and therefore made King Bali the Lord of Hell. Since then the fast of Parivartini Ekadashi is observed by the devotees. On this Ekadashi, a sleeping idol of Lord Vishnu is always kept with King Bali in Hell. This day is also observed as Vamana Jayanti.Parivartini Ekadashi 2023: Puja Rituals 1.

Offer home made sweets to Lord Vishnu and Panchamrit (mixture of Milk, Curd, Honey, Sugar and Ghee) and do not forget to put Tulsi Patra in each offerings.5.

On January 5, following widespread protests by local residents, the state government had stopped all works at the NTPC project site.Roorkee-based NIH, an organisation under Union Jal Shakti ministry, in its report submitted to Uttarakhand State Disaster Management Authority, has claimed that \"gushing waters at Jaypee Colony in Joshimath town had no connection with the hydel project.\" Local residents led by citizens\\' group, Joshimath Bachao Sangharsh Samiti (JBSS) and some experts had been claiming that the Joshimath disaster was the result of the NTPC puncturing aquifers with their tunnel-boring machines. However, NIH, in its report, a copy of which is with TOI, claimed otherwise. Quoting results of isotopic analysis of water samples, the report stated, \"The isotopic analysis suggested that the origin of the gush water in Jaypee Colony is from upper reaches (Sunil forest and Auli area). The water sample taken from NTPC sites differed from the water seeping through the aquifer at Jaypee.\" Speaking about the possible causes behind the burst of the aquifer at Jaypee, the NIH report went on to add, \"There may be a possibility that some temporary storage was created due to the blockage of any sub-surface channel, which eventually burst from the weak point when the hydrostatic pressure of stored water exceeded the soil-water bearing capacity of the area.\" The problem of subsidence in Joshimath had suddenly aggravated early this year, after a fresh aquifer burst on the night of January 2 with major turbid water flow. The experts of GSI also studied the blast-induced damages and possibility of the seepage from the hydel project\\'s \\'head race tunnel\\'. \"Prima facie, the very question of any blast-induced damages attributing to the current situation in Joshimath is unlikely as the alignment of HRT is located at a lateral distance of 1.1km from the urban sprawl of Joshimath. This stretch is excavated through tunnel boring machine, which is a non-destructive method of tunnelling without blasting,\" GSI said.',\n",

This, when an Interpol red corner notice (RCN) had been issued against the pro-Khalistan terrorist in November 2014. The dossier reviewed by TOI states that Nijjar ventured into gurdwara politics in Canada and acquired Canadian citizenship, the circumstances of which are not clear, to “protect himself from the RCN and to prevent his extradition to India”. Nijjar is said to have forcefully become president of the gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia in 2021, by fighting and threatening his cousin and then gurdwara president Raghbir Singh Nijjar. Nijjar, however, used his religious identity to turn the gurdwara into a prominent centre of Khalistani activities and build a community of radically-inclined Canadian Sikhs. An old associate of Khalistan Commando Force militant Gurdeep Singh @Deepa Heranwala,who was involved in over 200 killings in Punjab during 1980s and 1990s, Nijjar came in touch with Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) terrorist and later Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) chief Jagtar Singh Tara during his visit to Pakistan in April 2012. Tara, as per the intelligence dossier, imparted arms and IED training to Nijjar during this visit. In 2013, Tara sent US-based Harjot Singh Birring to Canada to train Nijjar in operating hand-held GPS devices. Nijjar started arranging funds for terror activities in India through his associates engaged in drugs and arms smuggling in Canada. He reportedly sent Rs 1 million Pakistani currency to Tara. As part of a plan with Tara to execute a terror attack in Punjab, Nijjar raised a gang in Canada which included Mandeep Singh Dhaliwal, Sarbjit Singh, Anupveer Singh and Darshan Singh. They were imparted arms training in British Columbia, Canada in December 2015, states the dossier. In 2014, Nijjar had planned a terror strike on Dera Sacha Sauda headquarters in Sirsa, Haryana on the directions of Tara. However, it did not materialise as Nijjar was denied an Indian visa. After the deportation of Tara to India in 2015, Nijjar assumed the role of KTF 'Operations Chief'. NIA registered several cases against Nijjar and got an RCN issued against him for raising a module in Canada involving Mandeep Singh Dhaliwal. Nijjar also worked with Punjab based gangster Arshdeep Singh Gill @ Arsh Dala to carry out terror activities in Punjab. He had tasked Arshdeep to murder father-son duo Manohar Lal Arora and Jatinderbir Singh Arora to avenge their “anti-Panthic activities” in 2020. In the attack, Manohar Lal was shot dead in Bathinda on November 20, 2020 but his son escaped. Nijjar had sent money from Canada for their murder, according to the dossier. In 2021, Nijjar tasked Arshdeep to murder a priest in Bhar Singh Pura. However, the priest survived.Hailing from village Bhar Singh Pura in Jalandhar, Nijjar was introduced to gangster life by Gurnek Singh@ Neka. After his name cropped up in many terrorism cases, Nijjar escaped to Canada in 1997 on a forged passport. He applied for asylum in Canada by claiming that he feared persecution in India. However, his asylum was rejected on the grounds of fabricated narrative. Just 11 days later, he entered into a 'marriage' agreement with a lady who sponsored his immigration. His fresh application was also rejected by Canadian immigration officials as his ‘wife’ had also arrived in Canada in 1997 on sponsorship by a different ‘husband’. Nijjar appealed against the rejection in courts of Canada and was later granted Canadian citizenship.\",\n",
       " 'Even as a row rages continues between India and Canada following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s allegations linking India to the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a pro Khalistan-terrorist, in June this year, a recent report in CBC News quoting sources said that the “Canadian government has amassed both human and signals intelligence in a months-long investigation” into the killing.CBC News said that according to sources, the intelligence includes “communication involving Indian officials themselves, including Indian diplomats present in Canada”.Nijjar was shot dead on June 18, 2023 outside a gurdwara in Surrey in Canada’s British Columbia province. CBC News also said that according to its Canadian sources, “when pressed behind closed doors, no Indian official has denied the bombshell allegation at the core of this case — that there is evidence to suggest Indian government involvement in the assassination of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.”You can read the CBC News report here. Did \\'Five Eyes\\' raise the issue with Modi?While the evidence that Canada has has not been shared with India yet, US President Joe Biden and other leaders expressed concern about the incident to Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G20 Summit held in Delhi earlier this month, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.Several members of the Five Eyes — an intelligence-sharing network that includes the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand — raised the issue with Modi, the newspaper said, citing three people familiar with the discussions at the summit.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Financial Times report, Reuters reported.The summit was held in India days before Trudeau made his allegations public in an address to the Canadian parliament earlier this week.The leaders intervened at the G20 summit after Canada urged its allies to raise the case directly with Modi, the newspaper reported.US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Thursday that the US is in touch with Indians at high levels following Ottawa\\'s claims about the murder and Washington is giving India no \"special exemption\" in the matter. India remains defiantWith no proof from Canada, India has called Trudeau’s allegations “politically motivated”. It also said the claims were marked by prejudice as Canada had expelled an Indian diplomat only on the basis of allegations.On Thursday, the Centre suspended visa processing services in Canada, saying Indian diplomats were unable to perform their duties because of threats from Khalistan forces.India also asked Ottawa to reduce its diplomatic staff strength back in Delhi. The Centre said there had to be a parity between diplomatic presence in both countries as Canada had a much stronger presence here than the other way around.Whether the government formally downgrades diplomatic ties will likely depend on how Canada reacts to the move.Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India was ready to look into any specifics of information from Canada, but so far there was none, and that India had again shared a list of more than 20 Khalistan terrorists with Canadian authorities, asking them to take action against them. While Canada has said it will share evidence in due course, its allegations so far seemed based only on what it calls credible intelligence.“We provided very specific information to Canada but it has not been acted upon. We have shared the same in the past too,” said Bagchi, adding that it is Canada that needs to worry about any reputational harm as terrorism is being funded and supported and safe haven being provided there.Trudeau skirts questions on lack of evidenceTrudeau, in fact, has been questioned repeatedly but he continues to stay mum on evidence to suggest India’s involvement in Nijjar’s killing.At a press conference in New York on Thursday, Trudeau was asked repeatedly if he had evidence, and of what quality, to back his claim.He, however, skirted reference to proof, but maintained there are “credible reasons to believe that agents of the government of India were involved”. He also called on Delhi “to engage with us to move forward on getting to the truth of this matter”.When asked if the Nijjar murder would take a backseat to the “harsh reality of international geo-politics” given India’s growing importance, the Canadian PM said, “We are not looking to provoke or cause problems.”“But we are unequivocal around the importance of the rule of law and unequivocal about the importance of protecting Canadians and standing up for our values. That\\'s why we call upon the government of India to work with us to establish processes to discover and to uncover the truth of the matter and to allow justice and accountability to be served,” he added. ‘Political issues unlikely to be long-term concern’ for studentsGiven the daily reports of political developments between India and Canada, those left confused are Indian students planning to pursue higher studies in the North American country.At an education fair in Hyderabad, representatives of Canadian universities advised students to consider planning their academic session for next fall/autumn in August 2024 due to the current turmoil.“We have been counselling students and telling them not to leave for Canada immediately,” said the representative of a university in Vancouver, underscoring the potential delays in securing study permits.A representative from an Ontario university said the institution would wait another week before finalising plans.Depending on the on-ground situation, they will decide whether to issue admission letters for January, May or for fall 2024, ensuring that students do not have to defer admissions due to visa delays.Participants at the fair however emphasised that despite current concerns, Canada remains an excellent destination for higher education, and political issues should not be a significant long-term concern.While feeling somewhat uncertain at the moment, students and parents attending an education fair in Hyderabad expressed hope for the situation to improve soon. “I am optimistic that this will be resolved, allowing me to pursue my second master’s degree in Vancouver in either May or August 2024,” said Ayisha Md.Leeladhar K, a BTech student, said he hasn’t ruled out Canada as an option. “However, I’ll make my final decision for my post graduation depending on the evolving relationship between India and Canada,” he said.',\n",

       " 'BENGALURU: If food, medicine or grocery ordered online can reach our doorstep in 30 minutes, why does it take hours on end for citizens to commute to work, school and for recreation in Bengaluru? Why cannot city administrators ensure these commutes too are wrapped up within 30 minutes? These are questions that often crop up in the minds of Bengalureans who brave perennial traffic snarls on choked city streets.Seeking to emulate this swift service delivery model, prominent policy thinkers and urban planners have now suggested that the state government adopt the 30-minute city concept in Bengaluru to streamline the availability of citizen services, including transportation, commute to work or catching up with friends and family in the neighbourhood. Their suggestions are part of a recent comprehensive report - Karnataka\\'s Decade - Roadmap to $1 Trillion Economy - prepared by the planning, programme monitoring and statistics department and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and released recently. The report seeks to draw a roadmap for Karnataka to emerge as a $1-trillion economy by 2033. Referring to the new concept, an urban thinker who was part of the roadmap planning, said: \"Despite its economic ability, Bengaluru lags many Indian cities on several civic and infrastructural parameters. Rapid urbanisation and economic growth have resulted in haphazard development across Bengaluru, impacting the health of citizens and the environment. We call ourselves a global leader in innovation, but at the same time, quality of life in the city continues to be poor. This is where the globally fast-catching concept of 30-minute city can help in resolving this urban mess and ensuring availability of all crucial services needed for a citizen in a day around their neighbourhood.\"Stating that the 30-minute city concept is fast catching up with developing countries as part of their sustainable development strategies, the policymakers added, \"The concept highlights the ability to meet most of our everyday needs locally, within minutes of stepping out of home by either by walking, cycling, riding or using public transport. Also, the concept helps strengthen the city\\'s municipal governance model which wields very little power at this juncture, given the fact that all decisions are taken at the government level. It is pertinent to decentralise governance and empower the metropolitan wards by creating these facilities accessible within 30 minutes.\" Listing out the advantages of the 30-minute city concept, the report said, \"Increased walkability and bikeability will lead to increased physical activity ensuring improved health. It reduces reliance on cars, curbing congestion and air pollution. Besides, it also improves spatial connectedness, encouraging social cohesion and community interaction. The concept also increases economic development by creating opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs to thrive.\" The report noted that neighbourhoods that are walkable, bikeable and replete with transit options contribute to empowerment of communities.',\n",
       " \"Ginger, a versatile and aromatic spice, has been an integral part of global cuisine and traditional medicine for centuries. Whether used for its bold flavour, culinary prowess, or medicinal properties, ginger remains a cherished ingredient in various forms. There are two primary variations of ginger - dry and fresh which offer distinct attributes when it comes to usage, nutrition, and health benefits. Here is all you need to find out about these two varieties, that can help you make informed choices. Fresh gingerWhen it comes to fresh ginger, it is known for its pungency, peppery, and slightly sweet flavour, and is often used as a foundational ingredient in a myriad of dishes worldwide. Its versatile nature allows it to be used in both savoury and sweet preparations. When it comes to the culinary preparations, fresh ginger is mostly used for making a variety of stir-fries, curries, soups, and marinades. It infuses dishes with a distinctive aroma and taste. Not just dishes, but fresh ginger can also be used in the grated or sliced versions, as that can help boost the flavour of teas, smoothies, or lemonades for a zesty kick. This variety of ginger can alos be incorporated into baked goods for adding a warm and spicy note. Some of the popular desserts made with fresh ginger are Gingerbread Cookies, Ginger Halwa, Ginger Cake, Ginger Laddoo, etc. In several Asian countries, fresh ginger is also pickled and served as a palate-cleansing condiment. While in Japan, its known as Gari (enjoyed along with Wasabi and Sushi), in India it is simply known as Adrak Ka Achar. Dry gingerWhen it comes to the dried form of ginger, it is popularly known as “Saunth or Sonth” in Hindi and is often used in powder. It is essentially fresh ginger that has been dehydrated and ground into a fine powder. This process significantly alters its flavour and makes dry ginger a concentrated spice. Some of the common culinary applications of dry ginger are that it is used as a key ingredient in spice blends like curry powder, pumpkin pie spice, and garam masala, lending a warm and earthy flavour. From delicious gravies to Tandoori appetizers or even tea; Saunth can bring a lot of change into the everyday food. Dry ginger has a warm potency and this is why, it is often used in chilly weather or winter season. This spice is also added to certain dishes to bring a subtle heat that can help warm the body. Some of the popular dishes made with dry ginger are Saunth Ke Laddoo, Hareera/Harira, Saunth aur Gud ki Chutney, variety of cakes and cookies, etc.ALSO READ: Why Mughals loved Saunth and what makes it so special in Ayurveda Nutrition and health benefits of fresh and dry gingerWhen it comes to nutrition, fresh ginger boasts a range of health benefits attributed to its natural form and the presence of active compounds like gingerol. It helps in digestion while reducing nausea, bloating, and indigestion. Fresh ginger also has anti-inflammatory properties that may alleviate symptoms of arthritis and reduce muscle pain. It is rich in antioxidants and vitamin C, and can boost the immune system. It is commonly used to alleviate morning sickness during pregnancy. While the drying process can cause a slight loss in some nutrients, dry ginger retains many beneficial properties and it may help in providing relief from inflammatory conditions like osteoarthritis. Dry ginger's concentrated compounds can help combat infections and inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria. Some studies suggest that dry ginger may help lower blood sugar levels. Similar to fresh ginger, dry ginger can help alleviate nausea and motion sickness. While fresh and dry ginger each offer unique flavours and they have their unique applications in the culinary world, they differ a lot nutritionally. Both forms of ginger cater to a variety of needs and the choice between fresh and dry ginger depends on your culinary preferences and the specific dish you're preparing. Whether you prefer the bold and zesty profile of fresh ginger or the convenience and versatility of dry ginger powder, there's no denying that ginger, in any form, is a spice worth including in your daily repertoire for both its flavour and potential health perks.ALSO READ: Tender coconut water: Benefits and precautions you should knowUses of gingerFrom masala chai to curries, ginger is always used to enhance the taste and aroma of any dish across Indian cuisines. And as per experts, it not only enhances the taste but also improves the nutritional value of the dish. When added to masala chai, it helps relieve cough and sore throat. And when added to curry, it helps reduce the acidic value of key ingredients like legumes.Uses of dry gingerIt is often used in cooking items with a longer shelf life. From laddoos, pinnis to mathris, use of dry ginger in the form of powder gives the perfect taste and aroma without disturbing the shelf life of the food items. Also, in case you are running short of fresh ginger at home, you can use dry ginger as the perfect alternative. The powder can also be used for Ginger Baths. All you need to do is, mix 1 tablespoon of dry ginger powder and mix it with an equal amount of baking soda. Rub it gently on the body for cleaning and see the magic.\",\n",

Counting of college-level votes for the morning sessions have started and although, the evening votes are yet to be counted — polling got over at 7.30 pm — the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) claimed they had won in 34 colleges, with clean sweep in 8 colleges. The National Student Union of India claimed it had won posts in 18 colleges and departments.The results of the university election held through EVMs will be declared on Saturday when the DUSU president, vice-president, secretary and joint secretary names will be known.Colleges, which voted on paper ballot, are likely to know their winners earlier as part of the counting is done.In all, 1.27 lakh votes were cast in the morning. For all students on the college campuses, this was the first time they voted. The last elections were held in 2019.The process was largely peaceful. However, the roads near colleges, even up to the metro stations, were strewn with pamphlets and cards of candidates in violation of poll norms.Third-year student Samiksha Jain at Ramjas College said: “It is quite nice to be able to finally vote. For me, the college union is essentially what matters. DUSU seems to be on a larger scale with hardly any contact with the candidates.”Kunal Nair, a first-year English (H) student at Dyal Singh College, said that he hoped the winning candidates would provide access to clean drinking water and better sports facilities.Miranda House had quite a rush to vote and students said their votes were mostly for candidates depending on the issues they had raised. This year, phones and smart watches were not allowed inside the polling booth.Vantika Raj, third-year chemistry student, said: “The student body should fight to bring changes to the syllabus followed at the university. There is more theory and very little practical work.”First-year geography (H) student Mohammad Wasiqullah said he had done his research before voting. “I didn't have the opportunity to meet the DUSU candidates. They were outside our college but didn't come into classrooms. I voted based on what I had heard through word of mouth and my research on these groups, their past victories and their track records.

       " 'NEW DELHI: Continuing to balance its expansive defence ties with both the US and Russia, India will dispatch military contingents to the two countries on Saturday to take part in combat exercises, even as Washington announced a new arms package for Ukraine’s ongoing war effort against Moscow.The `Yudh Abhyas’ exercise with the US in Alaska is a top-notch bilateral endeavour, while the one at Vladivostok in Russia is a multi-nation counter-terrorism drill, in which China will also participate.India, of course, remains concerned over the Russia-China strategic embrace amid the continuing military confrontation in eastern Ladakh, which is into its fourth year now, as well as the fallout of the ongoing war in Ukraine that erupted in February last year.A 350-soldier strong contingent from the Army’s Maratha Light Infantry Regiment will take part in the Yudh Abhyas exercise in Alaska from September 25 to October 8. “The focus of the brigade group-level exercise will be on combat operations in high-altitude and extreme climatic conditions,” an official said. The previous edition of the Yudh Abhyas’ exercise, incidentally, was conducted in the high-altitude region of Auli in Uttarakhand, barely 100-km from the Line of Actual Control with China, in November last year. Irked by the exercise, China had warned the US to not interfere in its relationship with India, while also accusing New Delhi of violating border agreements.A smaller number of soldiers from the Rajputana Rifles, in turn, will take part in the counter-terrorism field training exercise of the Asean defence ministers’ meeting (ADMM)-plus-EWG (expert working group) in Russia from September 25 to 30. The 10 Asean member countries as well as India, Russia and China are participating in the exercise.“The main objective of the exercise, which Russia is hosting as a co-chair of the EWG along with Myanmar, is to strengthen regional cooperation in the field of counter-terrorism. It will also provide the Indian Army with a platform to share its wide expertise in counter-terrorism,” another official said.In 2020, India had pulled out of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) counter-terrorism `Kavkaz’ exercise in Russia because Chinese as well as Pakistani troops were also taking part in the drills, as was then reported by TOI. The decision to withdraw had come after the sharp escalation in tensions with China following the violent clashes in Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15 that year.India and the US, of course, regularly conduct several exercises, which range from the bilateral `Yudh Abhyas’ to the Malabar naval wargames along with the other `Quad’ countries of Australia and Japan.During his visit to India for the SCO defence ministers’ meet this April, Russian defence minister Sergei K Shoigu had strongly lashed out at the US and groupings like the Quad and AUKUS (alliance among the US, UK and Australia alliance to provide Canberra with nuclear-powered submarines) as moves to contain China.',\n",
       " 'The US-led effort to embrace India within a global alliance of democracies against Beijing’s disruptions of the rules-based international order has been dealt a wicked sucker punch. Canada’s Indo-Pacific Strategy, Ottawa’s shiny new trade and foreign policy initiative, is a dead letter, and from their Canadian safe havens the most militant Khalistanis have been emboldened like no other time since Indira Gandhi’s assassination in 1984. It is quite a list of accomplishments Canadian PM Trudeau can claim for himself in just the first week of the fall sitting of the House of Commons in Ottawa. And that’s just where it starts.The Canada-India free trade talks, 12 years in the making, had already been mysteriously “paused” before the week began, and now nobody is willing to guess when the talks might resume, if ever. More than 80,000 Canadians visit India every year, but India’s external affairs ministry has now stopped issuing visas in Canada altogether, indefinitely.On Wednesday, India’s external affairs ministry issued an unprecedented travel advisory urging Indian nationals contemplating travel to Canada to be very, very careful. Further: “Given the deteriorating security environment in Canada, Indian students in particular are advised to exercise extreme caution and remain vigilant.”Canadians scoffed at the Indian government’s proposition. “Canada, by any standard, is one of the safest, if not the safest country in the world that is governed by the rule of law,” immigration minister Marc Miller responded, “so, I think people should read that statement for what it is.”But by Friday, Canada’s federal public safety ministry had issued its own alert: “The circulation of an online video in which Hindu Canadians are told to leave Canada is offensive and hateful, and is an affront to all Canadians and the values we hold dearly… We urge all Canadians to respect one another and follow the rule of law. Canadians deserve to feel safe in their communities.”Produced by the hardline separatist Sikhs For Justice group, the video features SFJ chief spokesman Gurpreet Singh Pannun demanding that Hindus in Canada leave Canada and go to India. It was Pannun who first alleged that Indian agents were behind the gangland-style murder of SFJ icon Hardeep Singh Nijjar outside the Guru Nanak Temple in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18. It’s that same accusation that was taken up by Trudeau in an extraordinary address to a shocked House of Commons Monday, enlivened by stern invocations of Canada’s sovereignty and the safety of Canadians. Indian PM Modi immediately and ferociously rejected the accusation as “absurd” and “motivated”. If there is a sinister motivation involved in the gauntlet Trudeau has thrown down, there are a few to pick from. The Trudeau Liberals have been plummeting in the opinion polls and Trudeau’s minority government is beholden to Jagmeet Singh’s New Democrats. Singh has long been identified with Khalistani conspiracy theories. Trudeau has also been under intense scrutiny in recent months owing to his close affinities with Beijing’s agents of influence in Canada, whose involvement in election-interference operations during the 2019 and 2021 federal elections is now suddenly overshadowed by the spectre of alleged Indian government “assassins”.While the international reverberations have been tectonic, it’s difficult to assess how seriously Canada’s allies are taking Trudeau’s claims.India and Canada immediately engaged in a one-for-one expulsion of diplomats, and there have been several pro-forma expressions of concern from a handful of Nato capitals. But it’s nothing like the support offered to the UK in 2018, for instance, when Russia was accused of attempting to murder Russian dissident Sergei Skripal in England. Back then, the US and 30 European countries expelled more than 100 Russian diplomats.On Tuesday, Trudeau insisted he wasn’t looking for an “escalation” of tensions with India. “We are simply laying out the facts as we understand them,” Trudeau told reporters. But he has offered no facts. While the insinuation in his statements Monday was clear and plain, Trudeau only alluded to “allegations” that law enforcement agencies were pursuing a “potential link” between Indian government agents and Nijjar’s murder. Trudeau called the allegations “credible”, but foreign affairs minister Melanie Joly later said only that the allegations would be a “grave violation” of the country’s sovereignty, “if proven true”.The names of the slain Nijjar and his champion Pannun both appear in about 30 terrorism and subversion cases prepared by Indian law enforcement agencies. India also insists that the SFJ organisation presents a clear and present danger to India’s national security and to Indian diplomats in Canada, and that Canada has failed to act on those threats.Prior to Trudeau’s Monday performance in Parliament, SFJ had produced leaflets in the style of “wanted” posters with names and the faces of India’s high commissioner to Canada, Sanjay Kumar Verma, along with his consuls-general, identifying them as Nijjar’s murderers. This week, SFJ has been distributing similar posters, with a $10,000 reward offered for the diplomats home addresses. SFJ says it plans to “shut down” India’s diplomatic missions on Monday.Since his murder, Nijjar’s face has routinely appeared on SFJ billboards and pamphlets along with the face of the “shaheed” Talwinder Singh Parmar, the mastermind behind the 1985 Air India bombing, the worst terrorist attack on civilian aviation prior to Al Qaeda’s attacks of September 11, 2001. The Air India bombing, which took the lives of 329 people, was planned and executed in Canada under the noses of RCMP and the Canadian Security Intelligence Services by individuals Canada had refused to extradite to India.Owing to a series of ignored warnings, botched surveillance operations and flubbed criminal proceedings, all the Air India perpetrators ended up walking free except for a single participant in the atrocity, Inderjit Singh Reyat. He was released to a half-way house in 2016 after 30 years in prison.One of the key Air India plotters was Ripudaman Singh Malik, one of several aging Khalistani militants who went on to participate in a reconciliation project undertaken by the Modi government – an initiative the Liberal government helped to shut down in Canada shortly after Trudeau’s election in 2015.Condemned as an “Indian government agent”, Malik had infuriated the unrepentant Khalistanis in Nijjar’s circle, and Malik’s murder in a targeted killing in the summer of 2022 led to the widespread belief in Surrey’s Sikh community that Nijjar’s faction was responsible, and later that it was the “Indian government agents” among Malik’s allies who took out a contract to have Nijjar killed in revenge.Whatever the case, a vast gulf of distrust that has separated India’s national security and intelligence establishment from its Canadian counterparts for the past 40 years has grown only deeper and wider, and that chasm now threatens to swallow up a panoply of vital diplomatic undertakings throughout the democratic world. And that’s just where it starts.The writer is a columnist, National Post, Canada',\n",

In a counterstatement, Petal Gahlot, the First Secretary at the United Nations representing the Second Committee of UNGA, asserted that Pakistan ought to relinquish the territories it occupies within India and cease all instances of cross-border terrorism. Petal Gahlot said, \"In order for there to be peace in South Asia, the actions that Pakistan needs to take are threefold first stop cross-border terrorism and shut down its infrastructure of terrorism immediately. Second, vacate Indian territories under its illegal and forcible occupation. And third stop the grave and persistent human rights violations against the minorities in Pakistan.\"The Indian diplomat reaffirmed that the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are intrinsic components of India.

Matters pertaining to the UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are purely internal to India,\" Petal Gahlot said.\"Pakistan has no locus standi to comment on our domestic matters.

Member States of the United Nations and other multilateral organizations are well aware that Pakistan does so to deflect the international community\\'s attention away from its own abysmal record on human rights.\"Calling Pakistan home to the largest number of internationally proscribed terrorist entities, Gahlot urged Pakistan to take \"credible and verifiable action\" against perpetrators of the 2011 Mumbai terror attack.\"Pakistan has been the home and patron to the largest number of internationally proscribed terrorist entities and individuals in the world. Instead of engaging in technical sophistry, we callupon Pakistan to take credible and verifiable action against the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks whose victims await justice even after 15 years,\" Petal Gahlot added.Shedding light on the systematic violence against minorities in Pakistan, Petal Gahlot addressed the plight of Christians and Ahmadiyya communities. She specifically referenced the tragic Jaranwala incident, in which Churches and Christian residences were maliciously set ablaze.\"A glaring example of the systemic violence against minorities in Pakistan was the large-scale brutality perpetrated against the minority Christian community in Jaranwala in Pakistan\\'s Faisalabad district in August 2023 where a total of 19 churches were gutted and 89 Christian houses were burnt down,\" the Indian diplomat said.\"Similar treatment has been meted out to the Ahmadiyya whose places of worship have been demolished. The condition of women belonging to minority communities in Pakistan notably Hindus, Sikhs and Christians, remains deplorable,\" she added.She made reference to a report published by Pakistan\\'s Human Rights Commission which revealed that 1000 women from minority communities were subjected to abduction and forced conversion and marriage. \"According to a recent report published by Pakistan\\'s own Human Rights Commission, an estimated 1,000 women from minority communities are subjected to abduction and forced conversion and marriage in Pakistan every year,\" Petal Gahlot said.Pakistan caretaker PM Kakar\\'s remarks came during his address to the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York today. He said, \"Pakistan desires peaceful and productive relations with all our neighbours including India,\" and added that \"Kashmir is the key to peace between Pakistan and India.\"India has consistently voiced its apprehensions regarding Pakistan\\'s endorsement of cross-border terrorism, emphasizing the incompatible nature of terrorism and diplomatic discussions.

       " \"NEW DELHI: Rather than take action, Canadian authorities put terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on ‘no-fly list’ in 2017-18, after New Delhi shared with them the details of over a dozen criminal cases of murder and other terrorist activities against him in India, as per a dossier on Nijjar compiled by the intelligence establishment here. This, when an Interpol red corner notice (RCN) had been issued against the pro-Khalistan terrorist in November 2014. The dossier reviewed by TOI states that Nijjar ventured into gurdwara politics in Canada and acquired Canadian citizenship, the circumstances of which are not clear, to “protect himself from the RCN and to prevent his extradition to India”. Nijjar is said to have forcefully become president of the gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia in 2021, by fighting and threatening his cousin and then gurdwara president Raghbir Singh Nijjar. Nijjar, however, used his religious identity to turn the gurdwara into a prominent centre of Khalistani activities and build a community of radically-inclined Canadian Sikhs. An old associate of Khalistan Commando Force militant Gurdeep Singh @Deepa Heranwala,who was involved in over 200 killings in Punjab during 1980s and 1990s, Nijjar came in touch with Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) terrorist and later Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) chief Jagtar Singh Tara during his visit to Pakistan in April 2012. Tara, as per the intelligence dossier, imparted arms and IED training to Nijjar during this visit. In 2013, Tara sent US-based Harjot Singh Birring to Canada to train Nijjar in operating hand-held GPS devices. Nijjar started arranging funds for terror activities in India through his associates engaged in drugs and arms smuggling in Canada. He reportedly sent Rs 1 million Pakistani currency to Tara. As part of a plan with Tara to execute a terror attack in Punjab, Nijjar raised a gang in Canada which included Mandeep Singh Dhaliwal, Sarbjit Singh, Anupveer Singh and Darshan Singh. They were imparted arms training in British Columbia, Canada in December 2015, states the dossier. In 2014, Nijjar had planned a terror strike on Dera Sacha Sauda headquarters in Sirsa, Haryana on the directions of Tara. However, it did not materialise as Nijjar was denied an Indian visa. After the deportation of Tara to India in 2015, Nijjar assumed the role of KTF 'Operations Chief'. NIA registered several cases against Nijjar and got an RCN issued against him for raising a module in Canada involving Mandeep Singh Dhaliwal. Nijjar also worked with Punjab based gangster Arshdeep Singh Gill @ Arsh Dala to carry out terror activities in Punjab. He had tasked Arshdeep to murder father-son duo Manohar Lal Arora and Jatinderbir Singh Arora to avenge their “anti-Panthic activities” in 2020. In the attack, Manohar Lal was shot dead in Bathinda on November 20, 2020 but his son escaped. Nijjar had sent money from Canada for their murder, according to the dossier. In 2021, Nijjar tasked Arshdeep to murder a priest in Bhar Singh Pura. However, the priest survived.Hailing from village Bhar Singh Pura in Jalandhar, Nijjar was introduced to gangster life by Gurnek Singh@ Neka. After his name cropped up in many terrorism cases, Nijjar escaped to Canada in 1997 on a forged passport. He applied for asylum in Canada by claiming that he feared persecution in India. However, his asylum was rejected on the grounds of fabricated narrative. Just 11 days later, he entered into a 'marriage' agreement with a lady who sponsored his immigration. His fresh application was also rejected by Canadian immigration officials as his ‘wife’ had also arrived in Canada in 1997 on sponsorship by a different ‘husband’. Nijjar appealed against the rejection in courts of Canada and was later granted Canadian citizenship.\",\n",

After that, we will cover the site according to norms,\" an MCD official said.Officials explained that the engineered landfill site will be different from conventional landfills as it will ensure disposal of waste in a technical and scientific manner. It will also have provision for a leachate treatment plant to avoid leachate percolation into the ground.\"We began work at the site after digging a 7.5-metre-deep pit in a 15.5-acre area and then laying a thick layer of earth and gravel at the bottom. Thereafter, we covered the whole area with three layers of liners or geosynthetic material as well as geosynthetic clay. A pipeline was laid between the layers for capturing the leachate. The bottom has been created with a proper slope so that the leachate collected easily reaches the treatment plant at a corner of the landfill,\" the official said.The concessionaire has created embankments of 2 metres high around the dug-up portion and covered these with layers of geosynthetic liners on one side. From outside, stone pitching will be done on the embankments to protect these from erosion in heavy rain.\"The ash generated after the incineration of waste at the WTE plant will be transferred to this site through a 200-metre conveyor belt. However, this facility will be provided after we fix the rates which the concessionaire (running the plant) is ready to pay us for taking the ash generated at their WTE plant,\" the official said.From the Okhla WTE plant, the residue will be transported.

       " 'BENGALURU: The decision of JD(S) to ally with BJP for the Lok Sabha polls is a complete turnaround from its stand in 2019 when it teamed up with Congress to take on the saffron party, then perceived as a common rival.But BJP swept the polls, winning 25 of the 28 seats in Karnataka. Even independent Sumalatha Ambareesh, whom BJP supported, won from Mandya — a JD(S) bastion — against Nikhil Kumaraswamy, HD Kumaraswamy’s son. JD(S) and Congress averted complete ignominy by winning a seat each.But now, with Congress emerging stronger after its stupendous victory in the assembly polls, BJP is likely to find it difficult to repeat its 2019 performance. The support of JD(S), especially in the Vokkaliga belt, will therefore prove vital.While the two parties are yet to decide on a seat-sharing formula, JD(S) is learnt to have sought six seats includ ing Hassan which it holds. But Kumaraswamy clarified that seat sharing was not discussed during Friday’s meeting. “It is not important how many seats we will get. The important thing is to meet the objective of winning all 28 seats together in Karnataka,” Kumaraswamy said.This is not the first time BJP and JD(S) have teamed up. The two formed a coalition government headed by Kumaraswamy in 2016 but fell out after JD(S) allegedly broke its promise of handing over the reins to BS Yediyurappa, deputy CM then, as per the 20-month each power sharing agreement.Former Prime Minister and JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda had disapproved of the alliance then but has blessed the new-found bonhomie. “Kumaraswamy is in talks with BJP functionaries. I will not react at this stage,” Gowda said in Delhi.Initially apprehensive over the proposal, BJP’s Karnataka unit appears to have come around, with most senior functionaries endorsing the alliance.Yediyurappa posted on X: “I wholeheartedly welcome @ JanataDal_S to NDA. This indeed is a natural alliance, and it will further strengthen our resolve to build a stronger and more self-reliant nation under the leadership of PM Shri Narendra Modi ji. Alliance will significantly increase vote share for the NDA in Karnataka.”',\n",
       " 'How can suicides be compared to a disease outbreak?The US’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a suicide cluster as a group of suicides, suicide attempts, or self-harm events that occur closer together in time and space than would normally be expected in a given community. In principle and practice, this aligns to the WHO definition of an outbreak. The Kota situation quite clearly is a suicide cluster. In specific, this is a case of a point cluster (or spatial-temporal cluster) where a greater-than-expected number of suicides occurs within a time period in a specific location. Contagion is best understood as the situation where one person’s suicide, due to its circumstances and the publicity around it, triggers the risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and/or deaths by suicide in others who are already vulnerable to suicidal thoughts or behaviours, leading to suicide clusters. This is certainly at play here.What makes the Kota cluster of suicides different from student suicides reported from across India? Several states such as Telangana, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have initiated helplines for suicide prevention when school leaving and/or entrance examination results are announced. The suicide cluster in Kota needs to be understood differently since these events are occurring not at a specific point in time, but through the year in preparation for examinations. Not just that, all of it is occurring in a single city in a very unique setting of residential coaching centres. This calls for very specific systems responses.How would a public health response be different from the kind of things being tried right now?Suicide clusters among young students such as in Kota are a matter of not just concern but tremendous urgency. It calls for a measured and effective response and, therefore, advanced preparation to be vigilant for suicides, and have strategies in place to forestall possible contagion and the formation of clusters. This entails putting in place a Suicide Cluster Response Plan comprising six specific activities:Surveillance – to identify and monitor occurrence of suicidal acts; Information sharing – between relevant agencies to ensure consistency of response; Media issues – to ensure responsible reporting; Bereavement support – to help those bereaved and affected by suicide; Prevention – to reduce risk of further suicides; Monitoring and review – to assess the impact of the response, what has been learnt and to inform future course of actionsHas such a public health response been tried anywhere and how well has it worked?A much-cited example is the three-tier Tomorrow Project in Nottingham, UK, that was developed in response to a local suicide cluster. It was set up in connection with a cluster of suicides between February 2011 and October 2012. A bereaved mother set up a self-help group in collaboration with NHS to successfully halt the ‘suicide contagion’. The generic steps included: Relevant and accessible information resources; community meetings to inform different groups about the risk of suicide, warning signs, how to respond and where to go for help; and clinical support delivered by therapists following self-referral.Is there any example of a public health approach to tackling suicides in India?India has just initiated the National Suicide Prevention Strategy (NSPS), which aims to reduce the number of suicides in the country by 10% by 2030. Two specific targets in NSPS are to establish efficient suicide surveillance systems in the next three years, and to create mental health outpatient clinics that offer suicide prevention services under the District Mental Health Programme within five years. It must be underscored that suicide clusters are generally uncommon; the Kota situation is a glaring example though. It cannot be over-emphasised that suicides are preventable and hence need prevention strategies framed through a public health approach, rather than knee-jerk quick fixes. The ‘causes of the causes’ are rooted in the competitive education opportunities that millions of young people are facing. Addressing that is a larger societal goal; responding to suicide clusters such as the one in Kota is a public health imperative.',\n",
       " 'Nagpur: Travel agent Nitesh Gaur is ready to swear an affidavit that he was compelled to pay ₹1,000 bribe to Jaripatka police last year for promptly verifying his eighth passport. Even as the cops are now harassing passport applicants by demanding numerous documents, there has been no action over the host of fraudulent passports facilitated by corrupt cops over the last few years.City police chief Amitesh Kumar had on Thursday said the verification was tightened as several illegal immigrants, including some Bangladeshis, had taken advantage of duplicate documents to prepare Indian passports. City police have so far not taken any action against cops helping the racketeers, including in the case where almost two dozen persons were booked for ‘kabootarbazi’ or illegal passport racketeering registered at Pachpaoli police station a few years ago. The fake passports had been prepared with the help of cops at Pachpaoli and Jaripatka police station.With complications increasing, city police top brass have only scaled up the verification process. Following instructions, cops from the ‘khufiya’ or intelligence wing have started demanding domicile and birth certificates mentioning the place of birth, tax receipts, and even documents of parents and forefathers. The usual documents like Aadhaar, Pan and ration cards are ignored, as they ‘can be faked easily’.A man in private service too claims to have paid ₹1,000 to Jaripatka police in the past to get verification process expedited for a passport applied under ‘tatkaal’ category.Gaur may not have any proof of the bribe he paid, but he highlights the arm-twisting methods of Jaripatka police to harass citizens. “The cops keep asking for various documents and testimonials, till the citizens get ready to compromise,” he said.Fearing cops would stop their verification and clearance, citizens rarely meet senior officers to lodge complaints or raise alarm regarding the under-the-table demands.Swapnil Kapoor, whose harassment by Jaripatka police was reported by TOI on Friday 22, 2023, said many applicants get their verification done within a short time while some cases remain pending. “The city police top brass must check pendency and quick disposal of some applications,” said Kapoor, who has lost almost Rs1 lakh due to delays and harassment by Jaripatka police.Sources from Jaripatka admit cops harass innocent persons but have given undue advantage to many illegal immigrants. “There is maximum corruption in visa extension among Sindhis coming from Pakistan and settling here,” said the source.A pharma company and real estate business owner made crores with a passport issued irregularly as he did not surrender the Pakistan passport. “There are several in Jaripatka dealing in herbal products, staying in India with the help of cops who manipulate their verification process,” said the source.',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: Continuing to balance its expansive defence ties with both the US and Russia, India will dispatch military contingents to the two countries on Saturday to take part in combat exercises, even as Washington announced a new arms package for Ukraine’s ongoing war effort against Moscow.The `Yudh Abhyas’ exercise with the US in Alaska is a top-notch bilateral endeavour, while the one at Vladivostok in Russia is a multi-nation counter-terrorism drill, in which China will also participate.India, of course, remains concerned over the Russia-China strategic embrace amid the continuing military confrontation in eastern Ladakh, which is into its fourth year now, as well as the fallout of the ongoing war in Ukraine that erupted in February last year.A 350-soldier strong contingent from the Army’s Maratha Light Infantry Regiment will take part in the Yudh Abhyas exercise in Alaska from September 25 to October 8. “The focus of the brigade group-level exercise will be on combat operations in high-altitude and extreme climatic conditions,” an official said. The previous edition of the Yudh Abhyas’ exercise, incidentally, was conducted in the high-altitude region of Auli in Uttarakhand, barely 100-km from the Line of Actual Control with China, in November last year. Irked by the exercise, China had warned the US to not interfere in its relationship with India, while also accusing New Delhi of violating border agreements.A smaller number of soldiers from the Rajputana Rifles, in turn, will take part in the counter-terrorism field training exercise of the Asean defence ministers’ meeting (ADMM)-plus-EWG (expert working group) in Russia from September 25 to 30. The 10 Asean member countries as well as India, Russia and China are participating in the exercise.“The main objective of the exercise, which Russia is hosting as a co-chair of the EWG along with Myanmar, is to strengthen regional cooperation in the field of counter-terrorism. It will also provide the Indian Army with a platform to share its wide expertise in counter-terrorism,” another official said.In 2020, India had pulled out of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) counter-terrorism `Kavkaz’ exercise in Russia because Chinese as well as Pakistani troops were also taking part in the drills, as was then reported by TOI. The decision to withdraw had come after the sharp escalation in tensions with China following the violent clashes in Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15 that year.India and the US, of course, regularly conduct several exercises, which range from the bilateral `Yudh Abhyas’ to the Malabar naval wargames along with the other `Quad’ countries of Australia and Japan.During his visit to India for the SCO defence ministers’ meet this April, Russian defence minister Sergei K Shoigu had strongly lashed out at the US and groupings like the Quad and AUKUS (alliance among the US, UK and Australia alliance to provide Canberra with nuclear-powered submarines) as moves to contain China.',\n",

Officials, however, said as tapping the mobile phones of diplomats would be against the Vienna Convention, advanced surveillance equipment like \\'off the air\\' or devices like cell-site simulators and IMSI catchers may have been used to tap in on the conversations, if at all. \"Trojans, which require zero-click or one-click for activation on the user\\'s end, are also used in such covert snooping by computers so as to take control of the target device,\" a security expert explained.Authorities were, in any case, perplexed by the mismatch between Trudeau\\'s allegation and his demand that India needed to cooperate on the one hand, and his reluctance to share evidence about the \"potential link\" on the other. Even as they raised the issue of illicit snooping, the intelligence officials mocked the suggestion that Indian diplomats were part of the assassination plot. \"Embassy officials, leave alone those of India which asks for and enforces complete scrupulousness by its representatives abroad, would never be involved in such tasks,\" said a senior government source.Sources in the intelligence community said the Canadian intelligence could, at most, be about some tittle tattle among Indian embassy employees in the wake of Nijjar\\'s killing, which was snooped on illegally.

After August 5, 2019, people have faced difficult times as JK’s “special identity was snatched and was bifurcated in two UTs”, the Mirwaiz said, describing his detention as the “most difficult phase” of his life after his father’s death. “I was forced to move courts and was informed yesterday by senior officers that I will be released.”The Mirwaiz had on September 15 moved the Jammu and Kashmir high court, which had sought the government’s response in four weeks.Asserting that he had “the responsibility to raise the voice for the people” as the Mirwaiz, the Hurriyat chief called for release of all political prisoners, journalists, lawyers, civil society members and youths. “I want to tell my people to be patient, to keep faith in the almighty,” he said, signing off by urging the gathering to leave the mosque “peacefully”.The request was kept, with divisional commissioner Vijay Kumar Bidhuri confirming the congregation concluded peacefully. “The credit goes to the people and (security) agencies, who took the decision after calculating things,” Bidhuri said. The allusion possibly was to releasing the Mirwaiz and allowing him to lead the prayer meet.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: Indian-American Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley has characterized China as an \"existential threat\" not only to the United States but to the global community at large. She asserted that Beijing is actively making preparations for potential conflict. During a significant policy address focused on the economy in the influential early primary state of New Hampshire, Haley said that China has dedicated fifty years to strategizing for the purpose of surpassing America. She further stated that in certain aspects, the Chinese military is already on par with the United States\\' armed forces.Her speech comes two days after her India-American Republican rival Vivek Ramaswamy delivered a foreign policy speech on China in Ohio. Both Haley and Ramaswamy have emerged as popular GOP candidates after former US president Donald Trump.\"Strength and pride are essential to our national survival, especially in the face of Communist China. China is an existential threat. It has spent half a century plotting to defeat us,\" Haley said.She alleged that China has taken America\\'s manufacturing jobs.\"It\\'s taken our trade secrets. Now it\\'s taking control of critical industries, from medicines to advanced technology. In record time, China has gone from an economically backward country to the second biggest economy on earth,\" she said.\"It has every intention of being the first. And the Communist Party\\'s motives are clear. They\\'re building a massive, cutting-edge military, capable of threatening America and dominating Asia and beyond,\" she added.\"In some respects, China\\'s military is already equal to the US armed forces.

       " 'BENGALURU: If food, medicine or grocery ordered online can reach our doorstep in 30 minutes, why does it take hours on end for citizens to commute to work, school and for recreation in Bengaluru? Why cannot city administrators ensure these commutes too are wrapped up within 30 minutes? These are questions that often crop up in the minds of Bengalureans who brave perennial traffic snarls on choked city streets.Seeking to emulate this swift service delivery model, prominent policy thinkers and urban planners have now suggested that the state government adopt the 30-minute city concept in Bengaluru to streamline the availability of citizen services, including transportation, commute to work or catching up with friends and family in the neighbourhood. Their suggestions are part of a recent comprehensive report - Karnataka\\'s Decade - Roadmap to $1 Trillion Economy - prepared by the planning, programme monitoring and statistics department and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and released recently. The report seeks to draw a roadmap for Karnataka to emerge as a $1-trillion economy by 2033. Referring to the new concept, an urban thinker who was part of the roadmap planning, said: \"Despite its economic ability, Bengaluru lags many Indian cities on several civic and infrastructural parameters. Rapid urbanisation and economic growth have resulted in haphazard development across Bengaluru, impacting the health of citizens and the environment. We call ourselves a global leader in innovation, but at the same time, quality of life in the city continues to be poor. This is where the globally fast-catching concept of 30-minute city can help in resolving this urban mess and ensuring availability of all crucial services needed for a citizen in a day around their neighbourhood.\"Stating that the 30-minute city concept is fast catching up with developing countries as part of their sustainable development strategies, the policymakers added, \"The concept highlights the ability to meet most of our everyday needs locally, within minutes of stepping out of home by either by walking, cycling, riding or using public transport. Also, the concept helps strengthen the city\\'s municipal governance model which wields very little power at this juncture, given the fact that all decisions are taken at the government level. It is pertinent to decentralise governance and empower the metropolitan wards by creating these facilities accessible within 30 minutes.\" Listing out the advantages of the 30-minute city concept, the report said, \"Increased walkability and bikeability will lead to increased physical activity ensuring improved health. It reduces reliance on cars, curbing congestion and air pollution. Besides, it also improves spatial connectedness, encouraging social cohesion and community interaction. The concept also increases economic development by creating opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs to thrive.\" The report noted that neighbourhoods that are walkable, bikeable and replete with transit options contribute to empowerment of communities.',\n",

Ali lamented that if a minority member was attacked with communal slurs inside Parliament, what would be the fate of ordinary Muslims. May quit Lok Sabha if Speaker does not take action: BSP\\'s Ali\"This is nothing less than hate speech. This is hate speech on the floor of the House. Hate speeches were being made outside Parliament but now hate speech has been delivered on the floor of the House by a BJP MP,\" Ali said. \"I expect that the Speaker will take action on this. But if action is not taken, then with a heavy heart, I can consider quitting the membership of this House because people have not sent me to Parliament to listen to hate speeches,\" he added.Ali wrote to the Speaker demanding an investigation by the privileges committee into Bidhuri\\'s \"most foul\" comments while Congress, NCP, TMC and DMK wrote to Birla separately with the same demand. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, along with party general secretary K C Venugopal, visited Ali at his residence to express solidarity with him. Ali is said to have broken down in front of Rahul Gandhi, asking what crime had he committed to deserve this humiliation.It capped a day of high emotions, when opposition members lashed out at BJP for nurturing \"hate speech\" to the extent of defiling Parliament, and Congress demanding that the Speaker refer the matter to the privileges committee. Party spokesman Jairam Ramesh said members had been punished with suspension for non-offences like raising slogans, while Bidhuri\\'s actions were an insult to every MP and Parliament. \"The PM claims \\'sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka prayas, sabka vishwas\\'. It is all bakwas,\" Ramesh said.Congress\\'s Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said, \"What is even more regrettable is the fact that this unprecedented, unfortunate and unsavoury incident has happened during the special session of Parliament.\"BSP president Mayawati said it was unfortunate that BJP did not take appropriate action against Bidhuri. CPM demanded that Bidhuri be arrested immediately, for which there could be no parliamentary privileges.

The party, however, asked opposition parties what action they had taken against their leaders for using abusive language against PM Narendra Modi more than 90 times. “BJP strongly condemns the use of any kind of abusive language. Taking immediate cognisance of the indecent remarks made by a BJP MP in the House, party president J P Nadda has issued a show-cause notice to the MP and asked him to reply within 10 days. Therefore, there should not be any kind of politics on this,” BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said. Soon after the incident, defence minister Rajnath Singh, who was present in the House, had expressed regret for his party MP’s remarks.Congress pulls up its MP in Chair for ‘inaction’Congress is said to have reprimanded its senior Kerala MP Kodikunnil Suresh for “inaction” as the presiding officer in Lok Sabha when Ramesh Bidhuri hurled abuses at BSP’s Danish Ali. A Malayalam speaker, Suresh could not grasp what was said by the BJP MP and responded to the commotion in a perfunctory manner. Asenior Congress office-bearer is said to have spoken to him. Speaking to TOI, Suresh said he could not understand what was said in Hindi, while the English translation was very slow, and that made it impossible to comprehend the words.',\n",

       " \"NEW DELHI: Rather than take action, Canadian authorities put terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on ‘no-fly list’ in 2017-18, after New Delhi shared with them the details of over a dozen criminal cases of murder and other terrorist activities against him in India, as per a dossier on Nijjar compiled by the intelligence establishment here. This, when an Interpol red corner notice (RCN) had been issued against the pro-Khalistan terrorist in November 2014. The dossier reviewed by TOI states that Nijjar ventured into gurdwara politics in Canada and acquired Canadian citizenship, the circumstances of which are not clear, to “protect himself from the RCN and to prevent his extradition to India”. Nijjar is said to have forcefully become president of the gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia in 2021, by fighting and threatening his cousin and then gurdwara president Raghbir Singh Nijjar. Nijjar, however, used his religious identity to turn the gurdwara into a prominent centre of Khalistani activities and build a community of radically-inclined Canadian Sikhs. An old associate of Khalistan Commando Force militant Gurdeep Singh @Deepa Heranwala,who was involved in over 200 killings in Punjab during 1980s and 1990s, Nijjar came in touch with Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) terrorist and later Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) chief Jagtar Singh Tara during his visit to Pakistan in April 2012. Tara, as per the intelligence dossier, imparted arms and IED training to Nijjar during this visit. In 2013, Tara sent US-based Harjot Singh Birring to Canada to train Nijjar in operating hand-held GPS devices. Nijjar started arranging funds for terror activities in India through his associates engaged in drugs and arms smuggling in Canada. He reportedly sent Rs 1 million Pakistani currency to Tara. As part of a plan with Tara to execute a terror attack in Punjab, Nijjar raised a gang in Canada which included Mandeep Singh Dhaliwal, Sarbjit Singh, Anupveer Singh and Darshan Singh. They were imparted arms training in British Columbia, Canada in December 2015, states the dossier. In 2014, Nijjar had planned a terror strike on Dera Sacha Sauda headquarters in Sirsa, Haryana on the directions of Tara. However, it did not materialise as Nijjar was denied an Indian visa. After the deportation of Tara to India in 2015, Nijjar assumed the role of KTF 'Operations Chief'. NIA registered several cases against Nijjar and got an RCN issued against him for raising a module in Canada involving Mandeep Singh Dhaliwal. Nijjar also worked with Punjab based gangster Arshdeep Singh Gill @ Arsh Dala to carry out terror activities in Punjab. He had tasked Arshdeep to murder father-son duo Manohar Lal Arora and Jatinderbir Singh Arora to avenge their “anti-Panthic activities” in 2020. In the attack, Manohar Lal was shot dead in Bathinda on November 20, 2020 but his son escaped. Nijjar had sent money from Canada for their murder, according to the dossier. In 2021, Nijjar tasked Arshdeep to murder a priest in Bhar Singh Pura. However, the priest survived.Hailing from village Bhar Singh Pura in Jalandhar, Nijjar was introduced to gangster life by Gurnek Singh@ Neka. After his name cropped up in many terrorism cases, Nijjar escaped to Canada in 1997 on a forged passport. He applied for asylum in Canada by claiming that he feared persecution in India. However, his asylum was rejected on the grounds of fabricated narrative. Just 11 days later, he entered into a 'marriage' agreement with a lady who sponsored his immigration. His fresh application was also rejected by Canadian immigration officials as his ‘wife’ had also arrived in Canada in 1997 on sponsorship by a different ‘husband’. Nijjar appealed against the rejection in courts of Canada and was later granted Canadian citizenship.\",\n",

There is more theory and very little practical work.”First-year geography (H) student Mohammad Wasiqullah said he had done his research before voting. “I didn't have the opportunity to meet the DUSU candidates. They were outside our college but didn't come into classrooms. I voted based on what I had heard through word of mouth and my research on these groups, their past victories and their track records.

Assistant inspector Mithun Mhatre of the crime unit said when they visited the Gokhivare talav, two witnesses, including a constable, said no one had sustained an electric shock on September 14.Investigation revealed that Mishra was carrying out electrical work at the marriage hall for a month. When cops approached Singh, he claimed that the closed circuit television (CCTV) was not working on September 14.The cops managed to get camera footage from a neighbouring housing society. It showed Mishra being carried to the nearby Mahavir clinic by five to six men. Three of them were tracked down and confirmed that Mishra was electrocuted while fixing wires in the marriage hall. Mishra's call data record showed he had not travelled to Gokhivare and was in the marriage hall the day he got electrocuted.MSEB officials have inspected the wires in the marriage hall.

       " 'BENGALURU: Chandrayaan-3 lander Vikram and rover Pragyan were expected to awake for a second innings on Friday, following Sunrise on the Moon on Wednesday, but Isro has heard nothing so far, although it continues efforts to revive the systems.Isro chairman S Somanath had told TOI on the day the sleep command was initiated that the lander and rover should awake automatically. \"...We\\'ve kept some circuits alive for this,\" he had said.Isro\\'s Space Application Centre (SAC) director Nilesh M Desai told TOI: \"We have our fingers crossed. We are hoping to hear something. It could happen later tonight (Friday) or even tomorrow; there is no way to say when.\" Another senior scientist said there was still \"a lot of time left\" and that Isro was waiting.Regardless of whether the two wake up for a second innings or not, the Chandrayaan-3 mission is successful, with all its objectives having been met. Vikram, in fact, exceeded the same by even performing a \"short\" lunar hop.Somanath and Chandrayaan-3 project director P Veeramuthuvel had told TOI earlier that the biggest challenge for Vikram and Pragyan\\'s waking up was the survival of the electronic components, given that the lunar night in the polar region could even breach -200° Celsius. However, it is not confirmed if Vikram and Pragyan had to endure temperatures so cold in the past 15 days.M Sankaran, director, UR Rao Satellite Centre, the Chandrayaan-3 lead centre, had explained to TOI earlier that the systems need an optimal Sun elevation angle - 6° to 9° - for systems to work. Aside from sunlight and the right elevation, there needs to be a rise in temperature above a certain threshold.Multiple Isro scientists TOI spoke with reiterated that Vikram and Pragyan waking up again would be a bonus second innings for the mission.',\n",

His personal and season's best of 8.41m puts him in the second spot among Asians behind compatriot Jeswin Aldrin.Jeswin Aldrin (men's long jump): His national record jump of 8.42m early in the season makes Aldrin the season leader among Asians. But he has been inconsistent after that big jump.Praveen Chithravel (men's triple jump): The season leader among Asians in triple jump and No. 6 in the world with his national record of 17.37m, the 22-yearold is a medal contender.Men's 4x400m relay: With an Asian record time of 2 minutes 59.05 seconds in the qualification round of the world championships, India is a gold medal contender in the men's 4x400m relay. The Indian quartet's time is also the eighth best in the world this season.Shaili Singh (women's long jump): The 19-year-old long jumper was a silver medallist in the Asian Championships in July and can go one step further.Parul Chaudhary (women's 3000m steeplechase): The number 2 in Asia with a season best and national record time of 9:15.31, the top spot at the Asiad is within her reach.Swapna Barman (women's heptathlon): A big gold medal contender, she will be defending her title. She was beaten by continental leader Ekaterina Voronina of Uzbekistan at the recent Asian Championships. Women's 4x400m relay: The Indian team is the number 1 in this event in Asia this season with the 3:30.41 seconds it clocked in July at a meet in Sri Lanka.Nikhat Zareen (51kg women's boxing): She is the brightest gold medal prospect from the boxing contingent. Nikhat has enjoyed an indomitable run in the past two years in the flyweight (51 kg) category. She has won the World Championship title twice, two Strandja Memorial titles and a Commonwealth Games gold medal. She will be eager to add yet another gold to her kitty at the Asiad.Lovlina Borgohain (75kg women's boxing): The Tokyo Olympic bronze medallist is still learning the tricks of the trade in the middle-weight category having bulked up from 69kg. Winning the Asian and World Championships gold in her new 75kg category will have surely boosted her confidence.Deepak Bhoria (51kg men's boxing): Armed with a lethal left hook, the pugilist from Hisar has a penchant for fearless boxing and defeating some of the giants of the game. He produced one of the best performances for India in recent years when he upstaged former world champion Saken Bibossinov at the World Championships in May.Bajrang Punia (65kg men's wrestling): Bajrang is a major prospect to win gold at the Asiad. At the 2018 Games, he clinched the top spot in Jakarta, Indonesia. He also secured an Olympic bronze in 2021, and then solidified his status as one of India's best grapplers ever with a gold at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games last year. However, with no international match experience for the past year, it is to be seen whether he can compete at his best.Antim Panghal (53kg women's wrestling): Considering her recent performances, after her bronze at the world championships, she is a big gold medal contender at the Asiad.Satwiksairaj Rankireddy-Chirag Shetty (badminton, men's doubles): The duo achieved a historic feat earlier in 2023 by becoming the first Indian pair to secure gold at the Asian Championships and will now look to repeat the performance at the Asiad.Men's hockey team: The team failed to live up to the expectations at the home World Cup early this year, finishing ninth, but India are still the favourites for gold.

D Gukesh, R Praggnanandhaa, Vidit Gujrathi, Arjun Erigaisi and Pentala Harikrishna make up a strong men's team, while Koneru Humpy and Harika Dronavalli - both among the best women's players in the world - lead the women's team.Men's kabaddi team: The Indian men's kabaddi team has won every Asian Games gold medal since 1990 except for the 2018 edition where they were beaten by Iran in the semifinals. In the recent Asian Kabaddi Championships, India emerged champions for the eighth time.Women's cricket team: Captain Harmanpreet Kaur will miss the early games due to suspension. But the team is a gold medal favourite for sure.Men's cricket team: The first-team players are preparing for the ODI World Cup. But led by Ruturaj Gaikwad, this team of T20 stars too will be strong contenders for a top finish.FLASHBACKIndia's first gold: Sachin Nag: In the history of Asian Games, India has won only one gold in swimming. And it went to Banarasborn Sachin Nag. Nag's effort was cheered live by PM Nehru who rushed to hug him. After all, this was also India's first gold medal in the 1st Asian Games held at Delhi in 1951. The swimmer also claimed two bronze medals in 4x100m freestyle and 3x100m medley.No other Indian swimmer has bagged 3 medals in Asian Games.

       " 'BENGALURU: The decision of JD(S) to ally with BJP for the Lok Sabha polls is a complete turnaround from its stand in 2019 when it teamed up with Congress to take on the saffron party, then perceived as a common rival.But BJP swept the polls, winning 25 of the 28 seats in Karnataka. Even independent Sumalatha Ambareesh, whom BJP supported, won from Mandya — a JD(S) bastion — against Nikhil Kumaraswamy, HD Kumaraswamy’s son. JD(S) and Congress averted complete ignominy by winning a seat each.But now, with Congress emerging stronger after its stupendous victory in the assembly polls, BJP is likely to find it difficult to repeat its 2019 performance. The support of JD(S), especially in the Vokkaliga belt, will therefore prove vital.While the two parties are yet to decide on a seat-sharing formula, JD(S) is learnt to have sought six seats includ ing Hassan which it holds. But Kumaraswamy clarified that seat sharing was not discussed during Friday’s meeting. “It is not important how many seats we will get. The important thing is to meet the objective of winning all 28 seats together in Karnataka,” Kumaraswamy said.This is not the first time BJP and JD(S) have teamed up. The two formed a coalition government headed by Kumaraswamy in 2016 but fell out after JD(S) allegedly broke its promise of handing over the reins to BS Yediyurappa, deputy CM then, as per the 20-month each power sharing agreement.Former Prime Minister and JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda had disapproved of the alliance then but has blessed the new-found bonhomie. “Kumaraswamy is in talks with BJP functionaries. I will not react at this stage,” Gowda said in Delhi.Initially apprehensive over the proposal, BJP’s Karnataka unit appears to have come around, with most senior functionaries endorsing the alliance.Yediyurappa posted on X: “I wholeheartedly welcome @ JanataDal_S to NDA. This indeed is a natural alliance, and it will further strengthen our resolve to build a stronger and more self-reliant nation under the leadership of PM Shri Narendra Modi ji. Alliance will significantly increase vote share for the NDA in Karnataka.”',\n",

Counting of college-level votes for the morning sessions have started and although, the evening votes are yet to be counted — polling got over at 7.30 pm — the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) claimed they had won in 34 colleges, with clean sweep in 8 colleges. The National Student Union of India claimed it had won posts in 18 colleges and departments.The results of the university election held through EVMs will be declared on Saturday when the DUSU president, vice-president, secretary and joint secretary names will be known.Colleges, which voted on paper ballot, are likely to know their winners earlier as part of the counting is done.In all, 1.27 lakh votes were cast in the morning. For all students on the college campuses, this was the first time they voted. The last elections were held in 2019.The process was largely peaceful. However, the roads near colleges, even up to the metro stations, were strewn with pamphlets and cards of candidates in violation of poll norms.Third-year student Samiksha Jain at Ramjas College said: “It is quite nice to be able to finally vote. For me, the college union is essentially what matters. DUSU seems to be on a larger scale with hardly any contact with the candidates.”Kunal Nair, a first-year English (H) student at Dyal Singh College, said that he hoped the winning candidates would provide access to clean drinking water and better sports facilities.Miranda House had quite a rush to vote and students said their votes were mostly for candidates depending on the issues they had raised. This year, phones and smart watches were not allowed inside the polling booth.Vantika Raj, third-year chemistry student, said: “The student body should fight to bring changes to the syllabus followed at the university. There is more theory and very little practical work.”First-year geography (H) student Mohammad Wasiqullah said he had done his research before voting. “I didn't have the opportunity to meet the DUSU candidates. They were outside our college but didn't come into classrooms. I voted based on what I had heard through word of mouth and my research on these groups, their past victories and their track records. Throughout my childhood, I witnessed elections involving major political parties like the BJP and Congress. Today, I experienced it at a smaller scale with student elections,” he said.In Ramjas and Kirori Mal in a few positions, candidates were elected unopposed.(With inputs from Shreya Ghosh)\",\n",

       " 'Nagpur: Travel agent Nitesh Gaur is ready to swear an affidavit that he was compelled to pay ₹1,000 bribe to Jaripatka police last year for promptly verifying his eighth passport. Even as the cops are now harassing passport applicants by demanding numerous documents, there has been no action over the host of fraudulent passports facilitated by corrupt cops over the last few years.City police chief Amitesh Kumar had on Thursday said the verification was tightened as several illegal immigrants, including some Bangladeshis, had taken advantage of duplicate documents to prepare Indian passports. City police have so far not taken any action against cops helping the racketeers, including in the case where almost two dozen persons were booked for ‘kabootarbazi’ or illegal passport racketeering registered at Pachpaoli police station a few years ago. The fake passports had been prepared with the help of cops at Pachpaoli and Jaripatka police station.With complications increasing, city police top brass have only scaled up the verification process. Following instructions, cops from the ‘khufiya’ or intelligence wing have started demanding domicile and birth certificates mentioning the place of birth, tax receipts, and even documents of parents and forefathers. The usual documents like Aadhaar, Pan and ration cards are ignored, as they ‘can be faked easily’.A man in private service too claims to have paid ₹1,000 to Jaripatka police in the past to get verification process expedited for a passport applied under ‘tatkaal’ category.Gaur may not have any proof of the bribe he paid, but he highlights the arm-twisting methods of Jaripatka police to harass citizens. “The cops keep asking for various documents and testimonials, till the citizens get ready to compromise,” he said.Fearing cops would stop their verification and clearance, citizens rarely meet senior officers to lodge complaints or raise alarm regarding the under-the-table demands.Swapnil Kapoor, whose harassment by Jaripatka police was reported by TOI on Friday 22, 2023, said many applicants get their verification done within a short time while some cases remain pending. “The city police top brass must check pendency and quick disposal of some applications,” said Kapoor, who has lost almost Rs1 lakh due to delays and harassment by Jaripatka police.Sources from Jaripatka admit cops harass innocent persons but have given undue advantage to many illegal immigrants. “There is maximum corruption in visa extension among Sindhis coming from Pakistan and settling here,” said the source.A pharma company and real estate business owner made crores with a passport issued irregularly as he did not surrender the Pakistan passport. “There are several in Jaripatka dealing in herbal products, staying in India with the help of cops who manipulate their verification process,” said the source.',\n",

       " 'BENGALURU/MYSURU: The bandh called by farmers and pro-Kannada organisations in Mandya district on Saturday, to exert pressure on the government not to release Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu, is expected to be total. Support has poured in from several organisations.Anticipating widespread protests, police have tightened security in Mandya, Mysuru, Chamarajanagar, Ramanagara, and Bengaluru. Home minister G Parameshwara said police are wellprepared to handle the situation in case untoward incidents occur. He said additional security has been deployed near KRS dam in Mandya district and other places where the protests are happening. Bengaluru city police too have stepped up security, especially in Tamilian-dominated areas, to prevent untoward incidents.“It is their right to protest,” Parameshwara said. “My appeal to protesters is to ensure public property is not destroyed. Protesters should not indulge in illegal activity and cause inconvenience to people.”Farmers under the aegis of Raitha Hitarakshana Samiti have been protesting in Mandya since August after the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA)asked Karnataka to release water to Tamil Nadu. They intensified it after the Supreme Court on Thursday refused to interfere with orders of the CWMA and the Cauvery Water Regulation Committee (CWRC) which directed the state to release 5,000 cusecs to Tamil Nadu until September 27.Karnataka has said it cannot release water as it will not have enough to meet its own needs for drinking and irrigating standing crops in the Cauvery basin. Protests have spread to districts like Chitradurga, Ballari, Davanagere, Koppal, and Vijayapura.Meanwhile, Nirmalanandanatha Swami, the head of Adichunchanagiri Mutt, a prominent Vokkaliga seminary in the Cauvery belt, joined protests on Friday. He will also lead protests in Mandya on Saturday. Actor Abhishek Ambareesh, son of Mandya MP Sumalatha Ambareesh, also took part in protests on Friday.Addressing farmers, the seer said that the state and central government should present facts before the Supreme Court and protect the interests of the farmers in the Cauvery belt. “There is a need to formulate a distress formula [to share water] at the earliest.”In Mysuru, farmers led by Karnataka Sugarcane Growers Association president Kurbur Shanthakumar were taken into preventive custody when they tried to lay siege to a meeting presided over by minister Byrathi Suresh and Rahim Khan at Mysuru zilla panchayat.',\n",

       " 'BENGALURU: The decision of JD(S) to ally with BJP for the Lok Sabha polls is a complete turnaround from its stand in 2019 when it teamed up with Congress to take on the saffron party, then perceived as a common rival.But BJP swept the polls, winning 25 of the 28 seats in Karnataka. Even independent Sumalatha Ambareesh, whom BJP supported, won from Mandya — a JD(S) bastion — against Nikhil Kumaraswamy, HD Kumaraswamy’s son. JD(S) and Congress averted complete ignominy by winning a seat each.But now, with Congress emerging stronger after its stupendous victory in the assembly polls, BJP is likely to find it difficult to repeat its 2019 performance. The support of JD(S), especially in the Vokkaliga belt, will therefore prove vital.While the two parties are yet to decide on a seat-sharing formula, JD(S) is learnt to have sought six seats includ ing Hassan which it holds. But Kumaraswamy clarified that seat sharing was not discussed during Friday’s meeting. “It is not important how many seats we will get. The important thing is to meet the objective of winning all 28 seats together in Karnataka,” Kumaraswamy said.This is not the first time BJP and JD(S) have teamed up. The two formed a coalition government headed by Kumaraswamy in 2016 but fell out after JD(S) allegedly broke its promise of handing over the reins to BS Yediyurappa, deputy CM then, as per the 20-month each power sharing agreement.Former Prime Minister and JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda had disapproved of the alliance then but has blessed the new-found bonhomie. “Kumaraswamy is in talks with BJP functionaries. I will not react at this stage,” Gowda said in Delhi.Initially apprehensive over the proposal, BJP’s Karnataka unit appears to have come around, with most senior functionaries endorsing the alliance.Yediyurappa posted on X: “I wholeheartedly welcome @ JanataDal_S to NDA. This indeed is a natural alliance, and it will further strengthen our resolve to build a stronger and more self-reliant nation under the leadership of PM Shri Narendra Modi ji. Alliance will significantly increase vote share for the NDA in Karnataka.”',\n",

However, Ashwin remains optimistic about securing a spot among the 15-member squad representing India in the quest for the coveted trophy. India\\'s journey in the 2023 World Cup will commence on October 8 in Chennai against Australia.The unfortunate injury to all-rounder Axar Patel has created a potential vacancy, and Ashwin is leaving no stone unturned in his efforts to claim that position should Axar fail to recover in time for the mega tournament. India captain Rohit Sharma has also voiced his support for Ashwin\\'s inclusion, stating that Ashwin is \"very much in line\" to make the World Cup squad.Before the first ODI against Australia on Friday, Ashwin\\'s last appearance in an ODI for India was in January 2022, during a match against South Africa.Following India\\'s convincing 5-wicket victory over Australia in Mohali, Ashwin, who claimed the wicket of Marnus Labuschagne while conceding 47 runs in his allotted 10 overs, was spotted engaging in batting practice. A video capturing this moment was shared by a user on social media after the match had concluded in Mohali.\"How cool is that?” former India cricketer Abhishek Nayar said on camera. “He (Ashwin) is batting right in the centre, he’s got a net out. And that’s where the support staff really works hard. It’s past 10, it’s late and they are still going. He’s got Rahul Dravid at square leg, Vikram Rathour at slips, Mark Waugh at fine leg, so it’s a terrific part of the preparation. I’m sure the management has told him to work on his batting.”During an interview on bcci.tv, Ashwin had admitted that the ODI series against Australia ODIs is a ‘big opportunity’ for him.“It’s a great opportunity for me. I have always said over the last 3-4 years that it’s not about what I want to achieve in these opportunities. I just want to enjoy myself, give myself the best chance. When I went back from West Indies, I took a break, played a few club games. The team management has kept me in loop and told me to just stay ready whenever there is a chance. I was just touching base with my fitness. Started bowling a few sessions,” Ashwin said.“I want to bring something different to the table so I have been working on some angles because one-day cricket is not just about spin anymore. It’s more about the angles, the usage of the crease, its depth. I’m trying to put myself in a zone of discomfort, to try and push barriers as always because for me what comes first is the pride of my performance and what best abilities and talent I can showcase,” he added.',\n",
       " 'Nagpur: Travel agent Nitesh Gaur is ready to swear an affidavit that he was compelled to pay ₹1,000 bribe to Jaripatka police last year for promptly verifying his eighth passport. Even as the cops are now harassing passport applicants by demanding numerous documents, there has been no action over the host of fraudulent passports facilitated by corrupt cops over the last few years.City police chief Amitesh Kumar had on Thursday said the verification was tightened as several illegal immigrants, including some Bangladeshis, had taken advantage of duplicate documents to prepare Indian passports. City police have so far not taken any action against cops helping the racketeers, including in the case where almost two dozen persons were booked for ‘kabootarbazi’ or illegal passport racketeering registered at Pachpaoli police station a few years ago. The fake passports had been prepared with the help of cops at Pachpaoli and Jaripatka police station.With complications increasing, city police top brass have only scaled up the verification process. Following instructions, cops from the ‘khufiya’ or intelligence wing have started demanding domicile and birth certificates mentioning the place of birth, tax receipts, and even documents of parents and forefathers. The usual documents like Aadhaar, Pan and ration cards are ignored, as they ‘can be faked easily’.A man in private service too claims to have paid ₹1,000 to Jaripatka police in the past to get verification process expedited for a passport applied under ‘tatkaal’ category.Gaur may not have any proof of the bribe he paid, but he highlights the arm-twisting methods of Jaripatka police to harass citizens. “The cops keep asking for various documents and testimonials, till the citizens get ready to compromise,” he said.Fearing cops would stop their verification and clearance, citizens rarely meet senior officers to lodge complaints or raise alarm regarding the under-the-table demands.Swapnil Kapoor, whose harassment by Jaripatka police was reported by TOI on Friday 22, 2023, said many applicants get their verification done within a short time while some cases remain pending. “The city police top brass must check pendency and quick disposal of some applications,” said Kapoor, who has lost almost Rs1 lakh due to delays and harassment by Jaripatka police.Sources from Jaripatka admit cops harass innocent persons but have given undue advantage to many illegal immigrants. “There is maximum corruption in visa extension among Sindhis coming from Pakistan and settling here,” said the source.A pharma company and real estate business owner made crores with a passport issued irregularly as he did not surrender the Pakistan passport. “There are several in Jaripatka dealing in herbal products, staying in India with the help of cops who manipulate their verification process,” said the source.',\n",

At the back of my head, I felt I needed a break for a series. \"I discussed with coach (Rahul Dravid) and captain (Rohit Sharma) and took a break (from the West Indies series).

Could it be a template going into the World Cup?\"It depends on the situation. How a partnership (is) going and how well you are bowling at that time. Sometimes, you end up bowling a six-over spell as well while sometimes you bowl only three overs.\"Shami admitted that heat does a play role.\"The heat does play a part and we are also human beings.

Amidst the uproar, the crime branch arrested the two shooters on Friday and uncovered a sinister attempt by a jailed gangster to extort money from Delhi\\'s businessmen.Special Commissioner (Crime) Ravindra Yadav confirmed that their investigation had revealed that jailed gangster Salman Tyagi had instructed his henchmen to extort Rs one crore from the two businessmen and had fired in order to instil fear in the business community.\"The arrested shooters have been identified as Deepanshu and Moinuddin, who live near Tihar Jail. They were tracked down by a special team led by DCP Sanjay Bhatia. Two semi-automatic pistols, five live cartridges, magazines, a scooty and a mobile phone used in crime have been recovered from them,\" Yadav said.The first incident was reported around 9pm on September 19. Two assailants on a scooty arrived at Zaika restaurant and fired two rounds. As people ran for cover, the men fled the spot waving pistols. Ten minutes later, the police control room received another call regarding firing at Gulati Handloom shop and rushed to the spot.

       " 'The US-led effort to embrace India within a global alliance of democracies against Beijing’s disruptions of the rules-based international order has been dealt a wicked sucker punch. Canada’s Indo-Pacific Strategy, Ottawa’s shiny new trade and foreign policy initiative, is a dead letter, and from their Canadian safe havens the most militant Khalistanis have been emboldened like no other time since Indira Gandhi’s assassination in 1984. It is quite a list of accomplishments Canadian PM Trudeau can claim for himself in just the first week of the fall sitting of the House of Commons in Ottawa. And that’s just where it starts.The Canada-India free trade talks, 12 years in the making, had already been mysteriously “paused” before the week began, and now nobody is willing to guess when the talks might resume, if ever. More than 80,000 Canadians visit India every year, but India’s external affairs ministry has now stopped issuing visas in Canada altogether, indefinitely.On Wednesday, India’s external affairs ministry issued an unprecedented travel advisory urging Indian nationals contemplating travel to Canada to be very, very careful. Further: “Given the deteriorating security environment in Canada, Indian students in particular are advised to exercise extreme caution and remain vigilant.”Canadians scoffed at the Indian government’s proposition. “Canada, by any standard, is one of the safest, if not the safest country in the world that is governed by the rule of law,” immigration minister Marc Miller responded, “so, I think people should read that statement for what it is.”But by Friday, Canada’s federal public safety ministry had issued its own alert: “The circulation of an online video in which Hindu Canadians are told to leave Canada is offensive and hateful, and is an affront to all Canadians and the values we hold dearly… We urge all Canadians to respect one another and follow the rule of law. Canadians deserve to feel safe in their communities.”Produced by the hardline separatist Sikhs For Justice group, the video features SFJ chief spokesman Gurpreet Singh Pannun demanding that Hindus in Canada leave Canada and go to India. It was Pannun who first alleged that Indian agents were behind the gangland-style murder of SFJ icon Hardeep Singh Nijjar outside the Guru Nanak Temple in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18. It’s that same accusation that was taken up by Trudeau in an extraordinary address to a shocked House of Commons Monday, enlivened by stern invocations of Canada’s sovereignty and the safety of Canadians. Indian PM Modi immediately and ferociously rejected the accusation as “absurd” and “motivated”. If there is a sinister motivation involved in the gauntlet Trudeau has thrown down, there are a few to pick from. The Trudeau Liberals have been plummeting in the opinion polls and Trudeau’s minority government is beholden to Jagmeet Singh’s New Democrats. Singh has long been identified with Khalistani conspiracy theories. Trudeau has also been under intense scrutiny in recent months owing to his close affinities with Beijing’s agents of influence in Canada, whose involvement in election-interference operations during the 2019 and 2021 federal elections is now suddenly overshadowed by the spectre of alleged Indian government “assassins”.While the international reverberations have been tectonic, it’s difficult to assess how seriously Canada’s allies are taking Trudeau’s claims.India and Canada immediately engaged in a one-for-one expulsion of diplomats, and there have been several pro-forma expressions of concern from a handful of Nato capitals. But it’s nothing like the support offered to the UK in 2018, for instance, when Russia was accused of attempting to murder Russian dissident Sergei Skripal in England. Back then, the US and 30 European countries expelled more than 100 Russian diplomats.On Tuesday, Trudeau insisted he wasn’t looking for an “escalation” of tensions with India. “We are simply laying out the facts as we understand them,” Trudeau told reporters. But he has offered no facts. While the insinuation in his statements Monday was clear and plain, Trudeau only alluded to “allegations” that law enforcement agencies were pursuing a “potential link” between Indian government agents and Nijjar’s murder. Trudeau called the allegations “credible”, but foreign affairs minister Melanie Joly later said only that the allegations would be a “grave violation” of the country’s sovereignty, “if proven true”.The names of the slain Nijjar and his champion Pannun both appear in about 30 terrorism and subversion cases prepared by Indian law enforcement agencies. India also insists that the SFJ organisation presents a clear and present danger to India’s national security and to Indian diplomats in Canada, and that Canada has failed to act on those threats.Prior to Trudeau’s Monday performance in Parliament, SFJ had produced leaflets in the style of “wanted” posters with names and the faces of India’s high commissioner to Canada, Sanjay Kumar Verma, along with his consuls-general, identifying them as Nijjar’s murderers. This week, SFJ has been distributing similar posters, with a $10,000 reward offered for the diplomats home addresses. SFJ says it plans to “shut down” India’s diplomatic missions on Monday.Since his murder, Nijjar’s face has routinely appeared on SFJ billboards and pamphlets along with the face of the “shaheed” Talwinder Singh Parmar, the mastermind behind the 1985 Air India bombing, the worst terrorist attack on civilian aviation prior to Al Qaeda’s attacks of September 11, 2001. The Air India bombing, which took the lives of 329 people, was planned and executed in Canada under the noses of RCMP and the Canadian Security Intelligence Services by individuals Canada had refused to extradite to India.Owing to a series of ignored warnings, botched surveillance operations and flubbed criminal proceedings, all the Air India perpetrators ended up walking free except for a single participant in the atrocity, Inderjit Singh Reyat. He was released to a half-way house in 2016 after 30 years in prison.One of the key Air India plotters was Ripudaman Singh Malik, one of several aging Khalistani militants who went on to participate in a reconciliation project undertaken by the Modi government – an initiative the Liberal government helped to shut down in Canada shortly after Trudeau’s election in 2015.Condemned as an “Indian government agent”, Malik had infuriated the unrepentant Khalistanis in Nijjar’s circle, and Malik’s murder in a targeted killing in the summer of 2022 led to the widespread belief in Surrey’s Sikh community that Nijjar’s faction was responsible, and later that it was the “Indian government agents” among Malik’s allies who took out a contract to have Nijjar killed in revenge.Whatever the case, a vast gulf of distrust that has separated India’s national security and intelligence establishment from its Canadian counterparts for the past 40 years has grown only deeper and wider, and that chasm now threatens to swallow up a panoply of vital diplomatic undertakings throughout the democratic world. And that’s just where it starts.The writer is a columnist, National Post, Canada',\n",

Soon, the concessionaire will apply for permissions from the department - Delhi Pollution Control Committee - for consent before making the facility operational. \"The facility will serve for the next six-and-a-half years and consume 9.64 lakh tonnes of residue generated at the two WTE plants. After that, we will cover the site according to norms,\" an MCD official said.Officials explained that the engineered landfill site will be different from conventional landfills as it will ensure disposal of waste in a technical and scientific manner. It will also have provision for a leachate treatment plant to avoid leachate percolation into the ground.\"We began work at the site after digging a 7.5-metre-deep pit in a 15.5-acre area and then laying a thick layer of earth and gravel at the bottom. Thereafter, we covered the whole area with three layers of liners or geosynthetic material as well as geosynthetic clay. A pipeline was laid between the layers for capturing the leachate. The bottom has been created with a proper slope so that the leachate collected easily reaches the treatment plant at a corner of the landfill,\" the official said.The concessionaire has created embankments of 2 metres high around the dug-up portion and covered these with layers of geosynthetic liners on one side. From outside, stone pitching will be done on the embankments to protect these from erosion in heavy rain.\"The ash generated after the incineration of waste at the WTE plant will be transferred to this site through a 200-metre conveyor belt. However, this facility will be provided after we fix the rates which the concessionaire (running the plant) is ready to pay us for taking the ash generated at their WTE plant,\" the official said.From the Okhla WTE plant, the residue will be transported. To make sure that the vehicles don\\'t damage the liners, there is provision for a 9-metre-wide concrete road around the landfill. Entry to the landfill will be given from one corner only.\"Between the concrete road and the landfill embankment, a provision for drainage has been made so that rain waste will not gather anywhere in the complex. To avoid chances of waterlogging within the dup-up area, pumps have been brought too. We will be covering dumped residue material with thin liners at every step,\" the official said.A concessionaire\\'s staff member said they had developed many scientific landfills for dumping municipal waste in different cities, but this would be the first time any facility was being developed for WTE plant\\'s ash or residue by them. \"We are in touch with IIT for implementing the project. The leachate collected will be studied first for quality verification and based on the results, will be utilised at the green belt to be created as per norms on 6.2 acres around the landfill,\" he said.',\n",

His personal and season's best of 8.41m puts him in the second spot among Asians behind compatriot Jeswin Aldrin.Jeswin Aldrin (men's long jump): His national record jump of 8.42m early in the season makes Aldrin the season leader among Asians. But he has been inconsistent after that big jump.Praveen Chithravel (men's triple jump): The season leader among Asians in triple jump and No. 6 in the world with his national record of 17.37m, the 22-yearold is a medal contender.Men's 4x400m relay: With an Asian record time of 2 minutes 59.05 seconds in the qualification round of the world championships, India is a gold medal contender in the men's 4x400m relay. The Indian quartet's time is also the eighth best in the world this season.Shaili Singh (women's long jump): The 19-year-old long jumper was a silver medallist in the Asian Championships in July and can go one step further.Parul Chaudhary (women's 3000m steeplechase): The number 2 in Asia with a season best and national record time of 9:15.31, the top spot at the Asiad is within her reach.Swapna Barman (women's heptathlon): A big gold medal contender, she will be defending her title. She was beaten by continental leader Ekaterina Voronina of Uzbekistan at the recent Asian Championships. Women's 4x400m relay: The Indian team is the number 1 in this event in Asia this season with the 3:30.41 seconds it clocked in July at a meet in Sri Lanka.Nikhat Zareen (51kg women's boxing): She is the brightest gold medal prospect from the boxing contingent. Nikhat has enjoyed an indomitable run in the past two years in the flyweight (51 kg) category. She has won the World Championship title twice, two Strandja Memorial titles and a Commonwealth Games gold medal. She will be eager to add yet another gold to her kitty at the Asiad.Lovlina Borgohain (75kg women's boxing): The Tokyo Olympic bronze medallist is still learning the tricks of the trade in the middle-weight category having bulked up from 69kg. Winning the Asian and World Championships gold in her new 75kg category will have surely boosted her confidence.Deepak Bhoria (51kg men's boxing): Armed with a lethal left hook, the pugilist from Hisar has a penchant for fearless boxing and defeating some of the giants of the game. He produced one of the best performances for India in recent years when he upstaged former world champion Saken Bibossinov at the World Championships in May.Bajrang Punia (65kg men's wrestling): Bajrang is a major prospect to win gold at the Asiad. At the 2018 Games, he clinched the top spot in Jakarta, Indonesia. He also secured an Olympic bronze in 2021, and then solidified his status as one of India's best grapplers ever with a gold at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games last year. However, with no international match experience for the past year, it is to be seen whether he can compete at his best.Antim Panghal (53kg women's wrestling): Considering her recent performances, after her bronze at the world championships, she is a big gold medal contender at the Asiad.Satwiksairaj Rankireddy-Chirag Shetty (badminton, men's doubles): The duo achieved a historic feat earlier in 2023 by becoming the first Indian pair to secure gold at the Asian Championships and will now look to repeat the performance at the Asiad.Men's hockey team: The team failed to live up to the expectations at the home World Cup early this year, finishing ninth, but India are still the favourites for gold. They won the recent Asian Champions Trophy in Chennai, which involved all the top teams from the continent.Chess team: There are some promising names in India's chess squad. D Gukesh, R Praggnanandhaa, Vidit Gujrathi, Arjun Erigaisi and Pentala Harikrishna make up a strong men's team, while Koneru Humpy and Harika Dronavalli - both among the best women's players in the world - lead the women's team.Men's kabaddi team: The Indian men's kabaddi team has won every Asian Games gold medal since 1990 except for the 2018 edition where they were beaten by Iran in the semifinals. In the recent Asian Kabaddi Championships, India emerged champions for the eighth time.Women's cricket team: Captain Harmanpreet Kaur will miss the early games due to suspension. But the team is a gold medal favourite for sure.Men's cricket team: The first-team players are preparing for the ODI World Cup.

And it went to Banarasborn Sachin Nag. Nag's effort was cheered live by PM Nehru who rushed to hug him. After all, this was also India's first gold medal in the 1st Asian Games held at Delhi in 1951. The swimmer also claimed two bronze medals in 4x100m freestyle and 3x100m medley.No other Indian swimmer has bagged 3 medals in Asian Games. The Sachin Nag residential block in Delhi's Asian Games village is a forlorn reminder of this great athlete.\",\n",
       " 'How can suicides be compared to a disease outbreak?The US’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a suicide cluster as a group of suicides, suicide attempts, or self-harm events that occur closer together in time and space than would normally be expected in a given community. In principle and practice, this aligns to the WHO definition of an outbreak. The Kota situation quite clearly is a suicide cluster. In specific, this is a case of a point cluster (or spatial-temporal cluster) where a greater-than-expected number of suicides occurs within a time period in a specific location. Contagion is best understood as the situation where one person’s suicide, due to its circumstances and the publicity around it, triggers the risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and/or deaths by suicide in others who are already vulnerable to suicidal thoughts or behaviours, leading to suicide clusters. This is certainly at play here.What makes the Kota cluster of suicides different from student suicides reported from across India? Several states such as Telangana, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have initiated helplines for suicide prevention when school leaving and/or entrance examination results are announced. The suicide cluster in Kota needs to be understood differently since these events are occurring not at a specific point in time, but through the year in preparation for examinations. Not just that, all of it is occurring in a single city in a very unique setting of residential coaching centres. This calls for very specific systems responses.How would a public health response be different from the kind of things being tried right now?Suicide clusters among young students such as in Kota are a matter of not just concern but tremendous urgency. It calls for a measured and effective response and, therefore, advanced preparation to be vigilant for suicides, and have strategies in place to forestall possible contagion and the formation of clusters. This entails putting in place a Suicide Cluster Response Plan comprising six specific activities:Surveillance – to identify and monitor occurrence of suicidal acts; Information sharing – between relevant agencies to ensure consistency of response; Media issues – to ensure responsible reporting; Bereavement support – to help those bereaved and affected by suicide; Prevention – to reduce risk of further suicides; Monitoring and review – to assess the impact of the response, what has been learnt and to inform future course of actionsHas such a public health response been tried anywhere and how well has it worked?A much-cited example is the three-tier Tomorrow Project in Nottingham, UK, that was developed in response to a local suicide cluster. It was set up in connection with a cluster of suicides between February 2011 and October 2012. A bereaved mother set up a self-help group in collaboration with NHS to successfully halt the ‘suicide contagion’. The generic steps included: Relevant and accessible information resources; community meetings to inform different groups about the risk of suicide, warning signs, how to respond and where to go for help; and clinical support delivered by therapists following self-referral.Is there any example of a public health approach to tackling suicides in India?India has just initiated the National Suicide Prevention Strategy (NSPS), which aims to reduce the number of suicides in the country by 10% by 2030. Two specific targets in NSPS are to establish efficient suicide surveillance systems in the next three years, and to create mental health outpatient clinics that offer suicide prevention services under the District Mental Health Programme within five years. It must be underscored that suicide clusters are generally uncommon; the Kota situation is a glaring example though. It cannot be over-emphasised that suicides are preventable and hence need prevention strategies framed through a public health approach, rather than knee-jerk quick fixes. The ‘causes of the causes’ are rooted in the competitive education opportunities that millions of young people are facing. Addressing that is a larger societal goal; responding to suicide clusters such as the one in Kota is a public health imperative.',\n",

Sumbul joined ETimes TV for an exclusive chat where she talked about her role in the show, her bonding with Mishkat Verma and more. She also spoke about how she puts pressure on herself to perform better. The actress also shared about her parents' reaction to her show Kavya. She stated that her mother doesn't belong to the industry and has seen her work in the past as well and she is liking her as Kavya. Journey as KavyaMy journey has been great so far and I’m enjoying each day. I’m grateful for everything I’ve got till now and whatever I’ve done till now. I’m very excited about the role of Kavya because it is a very different role. It is very challenging for me and that’s the reason I wanted to do the role. I wanted to challenge myself and see my limits, hence I wanted to do the show.On deciding to do Kavya The first time I heard the script, I had decided that I’ve to do this show. Main Maan chuki thi ke Mujhe ye show karna hai.. after that the makers liked my auditions and mock shoot also. Later, I met Mishkat also in office and slowly everything fell into place and we were finalised for the show.Sumbul on Kavya's look Kavya’s look has a mix of everything. It is not only just dressed in salwar suit or sarees. She is seen in pyjamas, track pants, salwar suits, western dresses, sarees, she wears everything. This is the best part about the character which I also personally like. It is very real and relatable because in personal life also we all were everything. The look is very simple and elegant.On her bonding with Mishkat Verma I initially didn’t know that Mishkat and I share the same zodiac sign. We both are Scorpio. My birthday is on November 15, and he is on Nov 17, this could be one of the reasons that we are getting along so well. We both came to give our auditions on the same day. Hum acche dost ban gaye over the period of time while talking with each other. We had a great time shooting with each other and have lots of fun.I feel I put a lot of pressure on myself to perform better Nobody puts any responsibility or pressure on me when it comes to work. I feel I put a lot of pressure on myself to perform better. Kabhi Kabhi Mujhe apne aap ko shaant karna padta hai that everything is going to be alright and I shouldn’t take this much pressure. I know one thing for sure I don’t want to let down the people who have always loved and supported me. I’m doing this show Kavya because I know they will love the character and the storyline as it is a very different character from all my previous roles. While playing Kavya, I will personally grow as an actor.Sumbul on her father's response to Kavya They are very proud of me and my father believes that I’m doing a great job as Kavya. I’m just waiting for them to watch the episodes. Everyone in the family is very happy about the new show. Just fingers crossed I want everything to happen nicely.Sumbul on her mother's response to Kavya She is also very proud of me. She is not from the industry or anywhere related to the industry. But she has seen me as Kavya and she has really liked me. In fact, she has seen my previous work as well like Imlie and Bigg Boss and she has always appreciated me.

       " 'BENGALURU: Karnataka on Friday indicated that it may not release the full daily quota of 5,000 cusecs of water to Tamil Nadu as directed by the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA).A state cabinet meeting, convened by CM Siddaramaiah, elaborately discussed the pros and cons of defying the CWMA directive, but did not come to any conclusion, ministers who attended the meeting said.A senior official said that we have been releasing 3,000 to 4,000 cusecs, but cannot release 5,000 cusecs. The cabinet also discussed convening an emergency special one-day session of the legislature to seek the opinion of elected representatives on the water-sharing issue, though no formal announcements were made to this effect.Following Friday\\'s late-evening cabinet meeting, deputy CM DK Shivakumar, who also holds the water resources portfolio, said: \"Our government is committed to respecting the SC directive and whatever share (of Cauvery water) is to be given to TN, we are bound to do it.\"While saying that it is the duty of the state to protect the interest of its farmers, the deputy chief minister indicated that some quantity of water will have to be released before approaching the court again for relief.However, a senior official privy to Friday\\'s discussions said: \"We\\'ve been releasing 3,000 to 4,000 cusecs of water every day, but we cannot afford to release 5,000 cusecs as directed by CWMA. However, we cannot go on record with this since it may tantamount to contempt of court.\" He added that Karnataka will move the Supreme Court and CWMA again to further explain its constraints.Karnataka\\'s latest stand will give some reprieve to the Congress government in the state that is currently under fire from agitating farmers in the Cauvery basin, who have called for a \\'bandh\\' on Saturday to protest the release of water to Tamil Nadu.Based on a recommendation from the Cauvery Water Regulation Committee (CWRC), CWMA had directed the state to release 5,000 cusecs of water daily to Tamil Nadu for 15 days, which was rejected by Karnataka.While standing by the government\\'s stance, Shivakumar also appealed to those who have called for a general strike in Mandya on Saturday to drop their \\'bandh\\' call, arguing that it would not help the state\\'s cause, even as he criticised the opposition for \"politicising\" the issue.\"A bandh won\\'t help. There could be a law and order problem. We will fight for the farmers. We have safeguarded their interests as much as possible and will continue to do so. But any violence [during the \\'bandh\\'] will bring disrepute to the state,\" he reasoned.Responding to the opposition\\'s criticism that the government had delayed seeking legal recourse, Shivakumar said: \"There is no question of delay. We were following procedures.\"Meanwhile, former CM HD Kumaraswamy said JD(S) will support Saturday\\'s Mandya \\'bandh\\' call.',\n",

       " 'BHOPAL/JABALPUR: No case is made out under IPC section 377 (unnatural sex) between a husband and wife as there is no bar on them from going beyond conventional sex, Madhya Pradesh high court has ruled, while quashing an FIR filed against Congress MLA Umang Singhar by his wife, accusing him of indulging in unnatural sex.Under the law, consent is not needed for sexual acts between a married couple, the HC said.Naogaon police in MP\\'s Dhar district had registered a case against Singhar, a former minister, in November 2022 under IPC sections for rape, unnatural sex, obscenity, voluntarily causing hurt, cruelty and criminal intimidation on the basis of a complaint filed by his second wife. He moved an application in the MP/MLA special court in Indore for anticipatory bail, but it was turned down. Then, he moved MP high court, which granted him anticipatory bail in March 2023, and has now ordered quashing of the FIR.Justice Sanjay Dwivedi, in his judgment, noted that the complainant and petitioner have admitted that they are wife and husband.\"...Sexual pleasure is an integral part of a husband and wife\\'s bonding with each other. Ergo, in my opinion, no barrier can be put in the alpha and omega of sexual relationship between the husband and his wife. Thus, in view of the amended definition of Section 375, offence of 377 between husband and wife has no place and as such it is not made out,\" Justice Sanjay Dwivedi said in his judgment. \"As per the amended definition, if offender and victim are husband and wife, then consent is immaterial and no offence under section 375 is made out and as such there is no punishment under section 376 of IPC. For offence of 377, as has been laid down by the Supreme Court in Navtej Singh Johar, if there is consent, offence of Section 377 is not made out,\" Justice Dwivedi said.\"Unnatural offence has not been defined anywhere, but as has been considered by the Supreme Court in the case of Navtej Singh Johar, any intercourse, not for the purpose of procreation, is unnatural. But respectfully, I find that when the same act as per the definition of section 375 is not an offence, then how can it be treated as an offence under Section 377 IPC. In my opinion, the relationship between the husband and wife cannot be confined to their sexual relationship only for the purpose of procreation, but if anything is done between them apart from the deemed natural sexual intercourse should not be defined as \\'unnatural\\',\" the judge said. Sexual relationship between the husband and wife is the key to a happy connubial life and that cannot be restricted to the extent of sheer procreation, the HC order says. \"If anything raises their longing towards each other, giving them pleasure and ascending their pleasure, then it is nothing uncustomary and cannot be considered unnatural,\" Justice Dwivedi said. He further said: \"If sexual intercourse for procreation... is considered to be natural sex, and sexual relations of husband and wife are confined to that extent, then in case any husband or wife is not capable of procreation, then seemingly their relationship would become useless, but it does not happen.\" The petitioner (Singhar) is a tribal and the complainant knew that he was married, yet she married him as his second wife as per \\'Adivasi\\' customs, the court pointed out. \"Their relationship became estranged sometime after marriage. They filed complaints against each other. The FIR was lodged by the wife without disclosing any specific date, time and place of the alleged offence... Therefore, the act of the petitioner is not punitive for the offence under Sections 376(2)(n) and Section 377 of IPC. There is no allegation of any demand of dowry... The complaint, in my opinion, is a malicious prosecution filed by the complainant as there was a dispute between them,\" the judge said while quashing the FIR against Singhar.',\n",
       " \"After entertaining one and all with her quirky videos on YouTube and Instagram, Srishti Dixit has now dabbled into acting with the latest release, 'The Great Indian Family'. While the film has hit the theatres, we got in touch with the young diva for a freewheeling chat. In the exclusive interview, Srishti spoke about the inception of the film, the response she has been getting for her performance, working with Vicky Kaushal and more. Excerpts...'The Great Indian Family' has hit the theatres. What kind of response have you been getting?I have been getting amazing responses from all my friends and family. They are so excited to see me in a Yash Raj film. They are acting as if I have become a Yash Raj heroine and I am feeling no less, honestly. I am feeling really grateful that this was my first gig that I received in the acting world and I shot for this three years ago and it's finally coming out. I am just so excited to see myself in a movie with such amazing actors. I am just very excited and I am really in that zone right now. I never thought in my wildest dreams that this would happen. And all the reactions to it are also matching that energy.How did you come on board for the film?Director Vijay Krishna Acharya, who has made 'Dhoom 3' and 'Thugs of Hindustan, is a terrific, amazing, brilliant, and intelligent person. I really respect and value him. He is the one who has given me this break. This was during the COVID pandemic when someone from the YRF team reached out to me saying that Victor sir (Vijay Krishna Acharya) is making this movie and he's written a story based on his own life and reflections. And it's like a deeply personal story. They wanted to know if I would like to audition for it. At first I thought it was a scam but it turned out to be a real one. I auditioned for the role of Vicky Kaushal's sister in the movie.I was shortlisted and then I got a call from Victor Sir and he said that he had named the character's name after his own sister's name. And he used to watch my content on Instagram and that's how he found me. He also said that he liked me and my UP antics specifically because he's also from Kanpur. He could relate to it and he found me really funny.How was it working with Vijay Krishna Acharya?It was amazing. He completely guided us throughout the process. It was the first time I was on a movie set. So I was extremely terrified of making a fool of myself because I have not even been trained in acting. I have been in amateur plays and I have done theatre in college and I have made stupid videos on the internet. But none of that is the same as being on a movie set and acting as a character in a movie. There were many rehearsals. There were many table reads. We got lots of opportunities to get together, jam, really collaborate on how we can bring out the best from all of us. And all the amazing co-actors I worked with, they were extremely helpful and they were very supportive. And they never made me feel like I was a complete idiot newbie who knew nothing. There was just so much love on the set and I hope that reflects in the film.The film boasts of an ensemble star cast. How was it shooting with this fun cast on the set? Whom did you bond the most with on the set?I think I got along really amazingly with everyone. I made some terrific friends on the set. There was so much learning I got to do just by observing other people do their job. It was such a big learning experience. No better training than that could have happened for someone who was doing their first ever film. And I think we really missed each other also after we finished shooting. So that's also a testimony of how great a time we had. We were also shooting for this in the middle of the lockdowns and the restrictions were just slightly easing up. People were just starting to come out of their homes again. So there was also that euphoric feeling. That was generally the vibe on set and everybody really got along like a family. There is no understatement in that.Vicky Kaushal is one of the most sought-after actors in Bollywood. How was he as a co-star?Vicky is just such a warm, open, humble and an amazing person. I didn't have any negative expectations of Vicky ahead of meeting him. I was just very nervous to be in the same frame as him and act with him. Because I have always been a huge fan of everything he has done. He is an amazing actor. He is the most hardworking actor. And I was just very nervous about my own thing. He really put me at ease. He was making jokes. He was making people comfortable. He is the most liked person on set and he is the most lovable person on set. And he just gave me this really nice, nurturing, friendly, warm energy that I hope reflects in whatever scenes I have gotten to do with him in the movie. He is an amazing co-star. I learnt a lot from just watching him act. I learnt a lot from just watching him prep, coming up with improvisations, coming up with ways to do things differently, giving amazing variations. I can't say enough about that. So I had a great time. I feel truly blessed that I got to do this for the first time ever with Vicky Kaushal, an actor of his calibre.Can you share some fun anecdotes from the movie from your shooting days?Honestly, every day was really fun. But I will truly cherish the time we had shooting for the movie in Madhya Pradesh. It was an outdoor shoot and all of us were staying at the same hotel. We were all eating and shooting together. It felt like all of us were living as a family in one spot. We were all talking every night. One day we listened to poems, one day we listened to stories. We even had a bonfire at some point. So we had a lot of fun. That was the most memorable time while shooting.After 'Gadar 2' fever, Bollywood is gripped by the 'Jawan' frenzy. What, according to you, will make 'The Great Indian Family' stand apart for the audience?My work was to do my best as honestly as possible and I hope I was able to do that. I hope that with whatever love and care we have made this film, reflects. And people can touch upon that when they watch it in the theatres. It's up to the people to give us their love once the movie is theirs. We have tried to do an honest job and we can only hope for the best. But I don't want to have too many expectations of what it will do for me, for everyone, for the movie business. I don't know anything about that. I am a very small part in the whole machinery. For me right now it's just absolutely delightful that a childhood dream of mine is coming true in this way. And that's all I could have asked for. And that's all I want to cherish and live in right now.\",\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI: Were Indian diplomatic personnel in Canada being snooped upon on the orders of the Trudeau government? Government functionaries were discussing the worrisome possibility in light of claims made by authorities in Ottawa to the Canadian media, that PM Justin Trudeau\\'s allegation of \"credible evidence\" of India\\'s \"potential link\" to the killing of pro-Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar was based on intelligence on communications involving India\\'s diplomatic personnel.Intel officials mock idea that Indian diplomats were part of plot to killWhile India did not respond to the allegations, intelligence sources said the claim deserved a deeper probe to ascertain if unauthorised equipment was used by local law enforcement to put Indian high commission officials under illegal surveillance.The development, coupled with the disclosure of Nijjar\\'s family that the terrorist used to meet with Canadian security intelligence service officers every week, has added another element of intrigue to the confrontation Trudeau has set off. Officials, however, said as tapping the mobile phones of diplomats would be against the Vienna Convention, advanced surveillance equipment like \\'off the air\\' or devices like cell-site simulators and IMSI catchers may have been used to tap in on the conversations, if at all. \"Trojans, which require zero-click or one-click for activation on the user\\'s end, are also used in such covert snooping by computers so as to take control of the target device,\" a security expert explained.Authorities were, in any case, perplexed by the mismatch between Trudeau\\'s allegation and his demand that India needed to cooperate on the one hand, and his reluctance to share evidence about the \"potential link\" on the other. Even as they raised the issue of illicit snooping, the intelligence officials mocked the suggestion that Indian diplomats were part of the assassination plot. \"Embassy officials, leave alone those of India which asks for and enforces complete scrupulousness by its representatives abroad, would never be involved in such tasks,\" said a senior government source.Sources in the intelligence community said the Canadian intelligence could, at most, be about some tittle tattle among Indian embassy employees in the wake of Nijjar\\'s killing, which was snooped on illegally. Officials highlighted the portion of news reports which quoted Canadian officials saying that the information was in the form of SIGINT (signal intelligence).\"This would require further elaboration to ascertain what kind of communication intelligence was tapped. It could just be the analysis of IP addresses showing a connection between point A and B or it could be actual conversations or an email. The likelihood of these having any specific conversations is negligible,\" another intelligence official said.',\n",

The cabinet also discussed convening an emergency special one-day session of the legislature to seek the opinion of elected representatives on the water-sharing issue, though no formal announcements were made to this effect.Following Friday\\'s late-evening cabinet meeting, deputy CM DK Shivakumar, who also holds the water resources portfolio, said: \"Our government is committed to respecting the SC directive and whatever share (of Cauvery water) is to be given to TN, we are bound to do it.\"While saying that it is the duty of the state to protect the interest of its farmers, the deputy chief minister indicated that some quantity of water will have to be released before approaching the court again for relief.However, a senior official privy to Friday\\'s discussions said: \"We\\'ve been releasing 3,000 to 4,000 cusecs of water every day, but we cannot afford to release 5,000 cusecs as directed by CWMA. However, we cannot go on record with this since it may tantamount to contempt of court.\" He added that Karnataka will move the Supreme Court and CWMA again to further explain its constraints.Karnataka\\'s latest stand will give some reprieve to the Congress government in the state that is currently under fire from agitating farmers in the Cauvery basin, who have called for a \\'bandh\\' on Saturday to protest the release of water to Tamil Nadu.Based on a recommendation from the Cauvery Water Regulation Committee (CWRC), CWMA had directed the state to release 5,000 cusecs of water daily to Tamil Nadu for 15 days, which was rejected by Karnataka.While standing by the government\\'s stance, Shivakumar also appealed to those who have called for a general strike in Mandya on Saturday to drop their \\'bandh\\' call, arguing that it would not help the state\\'s cause, even as he criticised the opposition for \"politicising\" the issue.\"A bandh won\\'t help. There could be a law and order problem. We will fight for the farmers. We have safeguarded their interests as much as possible and will continue to do so.

Soon, the concessionaire will apply for permissions from the department - Delhi Pollution Control Committee - for consent before making the facility operational. \"The facility will serve for the next six-and-a-half years and consume 9.64 lakh tonnes of residue generated at the two WTE plants. After that, we will cover the site according to norms,\" an MCD official said.Officials explained that the engineered landfill site will be different from conventional landfills as it will ensure disposal of waste in a technical and scientific manner. It will also have provision for a leachate treatment plant to avoid leachate percolation into the ground.\"We began work at the site after digging a 7.5-metre-deep pit in a 15.5-acre area and then laying a thick layer of earth and gravel at the bottom. Thereafter, we covered the whole area with three layers of liners or geosynthetic material as well as geosynthetic clay. A pipeline was laid between the layers for capturing the leachate. The bottom has been created with a proper slope so that the leachate collected easily reaches the treatment plant at a corner of the landfill,\" the official said.The concessionaire has created embankments of 2 metres high around the dug-up portion and covered these with layers of geosynthetic liners on one side. From outside, stone pitching will be done on the embankments to protect these from erosion in heavy rain.\"The ash generated after the incineration of waste at the WTE plant will be transferred to this site through a 200-metre conveyor belt. However, this facility will be provided after we fix the rates which the concessionaire (running the plant) is ready to pay us for taking the ash generated at their WTE plant,\" the official said.From the Okhla WTE plant, the residue will be transported. To make sure that the vehicles don\\'t damage the liners, there is provision for a 9-metre-wide concrete road around the landfill. Entry to the landfill will be given from one corner only.\"Between the concrete road and the landfill embankment, a provision for drainage has been made so that rain waste will not gather anywhere in the complex. To avoid chances of waterlogging within the dup-up area, pumps have been brought too. We will be covering dumped residue material with thin liners at every step,\" the official said.A concessionaire\\'s staff member said they had developed many scientific landfills for dumping municipal waste in different cities, but this would be the first time any facility was being developed for WTE plant\\'s ash or residue by them. \"We are in touch with IIT for implementing the project. The leachate collected will be studied first for quality verification and based on the results, will be utilised at the green belt to be created as per norms on 6.2 acres around the landfill,\" he said.',\n",

I’m sure the management has told him to work on his batting.”During an interview on bcci.tv, Ashwin had admitted that the ODI series against Australia ODIs is a ‘big opportunity’ for him.“It’s a great opportunity for me. I have always said over the last 3-4 years that it’s not about what I want to achieve in these opportunities. I just want to enjoy myself, give myself the best chance. When I went back from West Indies, I took a break, played a few club games. The team management has kept me in loop and told me to just stay ready whenever there is a chance. I was just touching base with my fitness. Started bowling a few sessions,” Ashwin said.“I want to bring something different to the table so I have been working on some angles because one-day cricket is not just about spin anymore. It’s more about the angles, the usage of the crease, its depth.

He stated that Hindus have made \"invaluable contributions\" to every part of Canada and added that the Hindu community \"will always be welcome here.\" Conservative leader Poilievre said that each Canadian deserves to live without fear in the country. His remarks come after Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, chief of Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a pro-Khalistan organisation banned in India in 2019, in a viral video, threatened Hindus of Indian origin and asked them to leave Canada. In a post shared on X, formerly known as Twitter, Poilievere said, \"Every Canadian deserves to live without fear and feel welcomed in their community. In recent days, we have seen hateful comments targeting Hindus in Canada. Conservatives condemn these comments against our Hindu neighbours and friends. Hindus have made invaluable contributions to every part of our country and will always be welcome here.\"Poilievre\\'s tweet comes amid strain in India-Canada relations after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday alleged that the Indian government was behind the fatal shooting of Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Nijjar, who was a designated terrorist in India, was gunned down in Canada\\'s Surrey on June 18.India has rejected Trudeau\\'s allegations and called them \"absurd and motivated.\" On Wednesday, Indian nationals, students in Canada and those planning on travelling to the country were advised to exercise caution, according to the Ministry of External Affairs.

He provided a statement. And I will just emphasize that he didn\\'t tell me anymore in private than he told Canadians in public.

I do find it interesting that he knew about vast foreign interference by Beijing for many years, at the same time as Beijing had kept two Canadian citizens hostage. And he said nothing. And he did nothing.

But if we have to choose between two friends, increasingly we\\'re going to choose India on this matter, simply because Nijjar was a terrorist, and India is too important. Our relationship is too important,” Michael Rubin added in his statement.He further slammed Trudeau and said that Hardeep Singh Nijjar — A khalistani terrorist is not a model to use for “human rights”.“Justin Trudeau might want to make this a case of human rights. The fact of that matter is, that Nijjar isn\\'t a model one wants to use for human rights. Nijjar may have been involved in the assassination of a rival Sikh leader, just a year ago. At the same time, he has blood on his hands through multiple attacks. He entered Canada with a fraudulent passport.\"He further stated that the Canadian PM was very “short-sighted” and was acting only as a “politician” in the matter.Rubin\\'s statement comes days after Canadian PM Justin Trudeau alleged India\\'s role behind the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, an allegation, India has out-rightly denied and called ‘absurd’ and ‘motivated’.This was followed by both countries expelling a senior diplomat in a tit-for-tat move.Nijjar, was gunned down outside a Gurudwara, in a parking area in Canada\\'s Surrey, British Columbia on June 18.Michael Rubin is a former Pentagon official and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute Specialisation in Iran, Turkey, and South Asia.(With inputs from agencies)',\n",

       " \"It’s nice to know that Fox News, which has so deranged America while making Rupert Murdoch ungodly sums of money, has in the end made Murdoch miserable, at least if the journalist Michael Wolff is to be believed. But the consolation is a small one.Murdoch’s unhappiness and befuddlement is the throughline of Wolff’s amusingly vicious and very well-timed book, The Fall: The End of Fox News, which is to hit shelves next week, days after Murdoch, 92, announced his retirement from the Fox Corporation and News Corporation boards. Wolff paints Fox’s owner as embarrassed by the channel’s vulgarity and horrified by its ultimate political creation, Donald Trump. Murdoch apparently very much wants to thwart the ex-president, just not at the price of losing a single point in the ratings.The Frankenstein Murdoch createdIn his tortured enabling of Trump, Murdoch seems the ultimate symbol of a feckless and craven conservative establishment, overmatched by the jingoist forces it encouraged and either capitulating to the ex-president or shuffling pitifully off the public stage. “Murdoch was as passionate in his Trump revulsion as any helpless liberal,” writes Wolff. The difference is that Murdoch’s helplessness was a choice.Few people bear more responsibility for Trump than Murdoch. Fox News gave Trump a regular platform for his racist lies about Barack Obama’s birthplace. It immersed its audience in a febrile fantasy world in which all mainstream sources of information are suspect, a precondition for Trump’s rise. (Many people have described losing loved ones to Fox’s all-consuming alternative reality.) After Trump lost in 2020, Fox helped spread the defeated president’s falsehoods about a stolen election, which both contributed to the January 6 insurrection and cost Fox nearly $800mn in its settlement with Dominion Voting Systems. (It was as part of that settlement, Wolff writes, that Fox fired its biggest star, the demagogic troll Tucker Carlson.)In Wolff’s telling, Murdoch is a sort of hapless Frankenstein, abominating the monster he set loose on the world but unsure how to fight him. This waffling, however, is a product of the same venality that has always undergirded Murdoch’s old-fashioned right-wing politics. In his farewell letter, Murdoch, the Oxford-educated son of a wealthy Australian media executive, poses as a populist, decrying a media that’s in 'cahoots' with elites, 'peddling political narratives rather than pursuing the truth.' This is pure projection: Fox exists to peddle self-serving political narratives, deceiving its audience under the guise of respecting it. In The Fall — a book that isn’t for anyone who doesn’t want to encounter casual slurs — Murdoch says of the celebrity anchor Sean Hannity, “He’s retarded, like most Americans.” The last thing Murdoch wants to do is risk lower ratings by leveling with the audience he looks down on.Yes, Trump was briefly banished from Fox’s airwaves, and Murdoch championed Trump’s putative rival, Ron DeSantis. But with DeSantis’s star falling, Fox has slavishly defended Trump each time he’s been indicted, while ignoring or minimising news putting Trump in a bad light. As of May 4, the liberal group Media Matters found, Fox had devoted a mere 13 minutes of airtime to Trump’s civil trial on charges of sexually assaulting the writer E Jean Carroll. “It was clear how much antipathy Murdoch had personally built up toward Trump,” writes Wolff. “But at the same time there was no change in his expectations as the owner of the country’s ratings-leading news channel.”Though The Fall is peppered with references to HBO’s Succession, Murdoch comes off as the anti-Logan Roy, desperate for the approval of his mostly liberal children, with the hateful Fox News standing between them. “He just wants his kids to love him,” Roger Ailes is quoted saying. “And they don’t.” In a chapter set in the winter of 2022, Wolff describes Murdoch fantasising about giving up Fox, which his friends urge him to do. They emphasise “how much better his relationship with his children would be without the curse of Fox News”.The futureBut breaking that curse would have meant turning Fox over to his son James, who feels the stain of Fox especially acutely and longs to remake it into a “force for good,” a phrase Wolff repeats with contempt. “James had become the avenging Murdoch — avenging what his family had wrought,” writes Wolff. “It was not enough to save himself and his family and the Murdoch brand from Fox. He had to save the nation.” Wolff sneers at James’s grandiosity, but if Rupert Murdoch truly wanted a redemptive final act, his younger son was probably the only one who could have given it to him.Instead, Murdoch has done the predictable thing and handed Fox to his son Lachlan, chief executive of the Fox Corporation, widely seen as the only true conservative among the Murdoch heirs. Wolff challenges the common perception of Lachlan as a right-wing ideologue, painting him instead as essentially apolitical and mostly interested in spear fishing.Nevertheless, of the Murdoch children, Lachlan is the one most likely to let Fox continue in its current groove. The network may keep boosting Trump’s Republican primary opponents, but once the primaries are over, we can expect it to once again be the lucrative propaganda arm of Trump’s presidential campaign. As long as Murdoch is alive, the future of Fox is unwritten. Once he dies, his four oldest children will determine who controls it, and James may yet prevail. But Murdoch’s legacy is decided. We are hurling toward another government shutdown, egged on by Hannity. The electorate that Fox helped shape, and the politicians it indulges, have made this country ungovernable. An unbound Trump may well become president again, bringing liberal democracy in America to a grotesque end. If so, it will be in large part Murdoch’s fault. “The Murdochs feel bad, about Tucker, about Trump, about themselves,” writes Wolff. Just not bad enough.\",\n",

       " 'BENGALURU/MYSURU: The bandh called by farmers and pro-Kannada organisations in Mandya district on Saturday, to exert pressure on the government not to release Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu, is expected to be total. Support has poured in from several organisations.Anticipating widespread protests, police have tightened security in Mandya, Mysuru, Chamarajanagar, Ramanagara, and Bengaluru. Home minister G Parameshwara said police are wellprepared to handle the situation in case untoward incidents occur. He said additional security has been deployed near KRS dam in Mandya district and other places where the protests are happening. Bengaluru city police too have stepped up security, especially in Tamilian-dominated areas, to prevent untoward incidents.“It is their right to protest,” Parameshwara said. “My appeal to protesters is to ensure public property is not destroyed. Protesters should not indulge in illegal activity and cause inconvenience to people.”Farmers under the aegis of Raitha Hitarakshana Samiti have been protesting in Mandya since August after the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA)asked Karnataka to release water to Tamil Nadu. They intensified it after the Supreme Court on Thursday refused to interfere with orders of the CWMA and the Cauvery Water Regulation Committee (CWRC) which directed the state to release 5,000 cusecs to Tamil Nadu until September 27.Karnataka has said it cannot release water as it will not have enough to meet its own needs for drinking and irrigating standing crops in the Cauvery basin. Protests have spread to districts like Chitradurga, Ballari, Davanagere, Koppal, and Vijayapura.Meanwhile, Nirmalanandanatha Swami, the head of Adichunchanagiri Mutt, a prominent Vokkaliga seminary in the Cauvery belt, joined protests on Friday. He will also lead protests in Mandya on Saturday. Actor Abhishek Ambareesh, son of Mandya MP Sumalatha Ambareesh, also took part in protests on Friday.Addressing farmers, the seer said that the state and central government should present facts before the Supreme Court and protect the interests of the farmers in the Cauvery belt. “There is a need to formulate a distress formula [to share water] at the earliest.”In Mysuru, farmers led by Karnataka Sugarcane Growers Association president Kurbur Shanthakumar were taken into preventive custody when they tried to lay siege to a meeting presided over by minister Byrathi Suresh and Rahim Khan at Mysuru zilla panchayat.',\n",

       " 'Even as a row rages continues between India and Canada following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s allegations linking India to the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a pro Khalistan-terrorist, in June this year, a recent report in CBC News quoting sources said that the “Canadian government has amassed both human and signals intelligence in a months-long investigation” into the killing.CBC News said that according to sources, the intelligence includes “communication involving Indian officials themselves, including Indian diplomats present in Canada”.Nijjar was shot dead on June 18, 2023 outside a gurdwara in Surrey in Canada’s British Columbia province. CBC News also said that according to its Canadian sources, “when pressed behind closed doors, no Indian official has denied the bombshell allegation at the core of this case — that there is evidence to suggest Indian government involvement in the assassination of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.”You can read the CBC News report here. Did \\'Five Eyes\\' raise the issue with Modi?While the evidence that Canada has has not been shared with India yet, US President Joe Biden and other leaders expressed concern about the incident to Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G20 Summit held in Delhi earlier this month, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.Several members of the Five Eyes — an intelligence-sharing network that includes the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand — raised the issue with Modi, the newspaper said, citing three people familiar with the discussions at the summit.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Financial Times report, Reuters reported.The summit was held in India days before Trudeau made his allegations public in an address to the Canadian parliament earlier this week.The leaders intervened at the G20 summit after Canada urged its allies to raise the case directly with Modi, the newspaper reported.US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Thursday that the US is in touch with Indians at high levels following Ottawa\\'s claims about the murder and Washington is giving India no \"special exemption\" in the matter. India remains defiantWith no proof from Canada, India has called Trudeau’s allegations “politically motivated”. It also said the claims were marked by prejudice as Canada had expelled an Indian diplomat only on the basis of allegations.On Thursday, the Centre suspended visa processing services in Canada, saying Indian diplomats were unable to perform their duties because of threats from Khalistan forces.India also asked Ottawa to reduce its diplomatic staff strength back in Delhi. The Centre said there had to be a parity between diplomatic presence in both countries as Canada had a much stronger presence here than the other way around.Whether the government formally downgrades diplomatic ties will likely depend on how Canada reacts to the move.Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India was ready to look into any specifics of information from Canada, but so far there was none, and that India had again shared a list of more than 20 Khalistan terrorists with Canadian authorities, asking them to take action against them. While Canada has said it will share evidence in due course, its allegations so far seemed based only on what it calls credible intelligence.“We provided very specific information to Canada but it has not been acted upon. We have shared the same in the past too,” said Bagchi, adding that it is Canada that needs to worry about any reputational harm as terrorism is being funded and supported and safe haven being provided there.Trudeau skirts questions on lack of evidenceTrudeau, in fact, has been questioned repeatedly but he continues to stay mum on evidence to suggest India’s involvement in Nijjar’s killing.At a press conference in New York on Thursday, Trudeau was asked repeatedly if he had evidence, and of what quality, to back his claim.He, however, skirted reference to proof, but maintained there are “credible reasons to believe that agents of the government of India were involved”. He also called on Delhi “to engage with us to move forward on getting to the truth of this matter”.When asked if the Nijjar murder would take a backseat to the “harsh reality of international geo-politics” given India’s growing importance, the Canadian PM said, “We are not looking to provoke or cause problems.”“But we are unequivocal around the importance of the rule of law and unequivocal about the importance of protecting Canadians and standing up for our values. That\\'s why we call upon the government of India to work with us to establish processes to discover and to uncover the truth of the matter and to allow justice and accountability to be served,” he added. ‘Political issues unlikely to be long-term concern’ for studentsGiven the daily reports of political developments between India and Canada, those left confused are Indian students planning to pursue higher studies in the North American country.At an education fair in Hyderabad, representatives of Canadian universities advised students to consider planning their academic session for next fall/autumn in August 2024 due to the current turmoil.“We have been counselling students and telling them not to leave for Canada immediately,” said the representative of a university in Vancouver, underscoring the potential delays in securing study permits.A representative from an Ontario university said the institution would wait another week before finalising plans.Depending on the on-ground situation, they will decide whether to issue admission letters for January, May or for fall 2024, ensuring that students do not have to defer admissions due to visa delays.Participants at the fair however emphasised that despite current concerns, Canada remains an excellent destination for higher education, and political issues should not be a significant long-term concern.While feeling somewhat uncertain at the moment, students and parents attending an education fair in Hyderabad expressed hope for the situation to improve soon. “I am optimistic that this will be resolved, allowing me to pursue my second master’s degree in Vancouver in either May or August 2024,” said Ayisha Md.Leeladhar K, a BTech student, said he hasn’t ruled out Canada as an option. “However, I’ll make my final decision for my post graduation depending on the evolving relationship between India and Canada,” he said.',\n",

       " \"NEW DELHI: An all-round India eased past a formidable Australia by five wickets in the series opener in Mohali to script a rare rankings history on Friday. With the comfortable win, not only India took a 1-0 series lead, the team also became the no.1 ODI side in the latest ICC rankings. Already at the numero uno spot in the Test and T20I formats, India achieved a rare feat, becoming the top-ranked side across all three formats. Before the start of the series, India were tied with arch-rivals Pakistan at 115 points in ODIs but a win today has taken India a point clear in the 50-over format. The architects of India's win were pacer Mohammed Shami and the young openers Shubman Gill and Ruturaj Gaikwad, who played impactful knocks to set up the win. After a Shami fifer restricted a batting-heavy Australia to 276 all out, new opening pair of Gill and Ruturaj shared a massive 142-run opening stand. Stand-in skipper KL Rahul and Suryakumar Yadav too hit crucial half-centuries as India chased down the total with 8 balls to spare.Here's a look at the key moments of the series opener at the IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali. Early Marsh blow and a 94-run standAs India won the toss and opted to bowl, Shami got the hosts off to a perfect start, dismissing dangerous Mitchell Marsh four balls into the contest. As a Shami’s jaffa took the outside edge of Marsh's bat, Gill completed an easy catch to give Australia an early blow. With a wicket down in the first over itself, Australia's most experienced batters David Warner and Steve Smith joined hands to stitch a terrific second-wicket partnership. The duo added 94 runs, stabilised the innings and laid a solid platform for their side. Scoring at the quick rate as well, the Warner-Smith partnership came off just 106 balls with Warner (52) getting to his 29th ODI fifty amid a solid stand. However, all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja eventually broke the threatening stand, removing Warner soon after his fifty in the 19th over.Quick wickets peg back Australia but middle-order fights backWith Jadeja managing to break the solid second wicket stand, it opened the door for India to make a comeback. India grabbed the chance with both hands as Smith soon joined Warner back to the pavilion. Shami came back into the attack and knocked over Smith for 41, India now had two wickets in quick succession. The bowlers then bowled tight lines in the middle overs to restrict Australia's scoring. Marnus Labuschagne and Cameron Green did manage a 45-run stand but looked a bit jittery in the middle. While the India fielders were a bit sloppy, luck did go their way when Labuschagne suffered an unfortunate stumping in the 33rd over. Labuschagne tried to reverse sweep Ashwin, but the ball hit keeper KL Rahul's pad and went on to hit the stumps with the batter's backfoot over the line. After the fall of Labuschagne, there was another brief stand but a really bad mix-up between Green and Josh Inglis cost the former his wicket for 31. With loss of wickets at regular intervals, Australia were 186 for 5 in the 40th over and were in desperate need of a partnership when all-rounder Marcus Stoinis arrived in the middle. With his counterattacking strokeplay, Stoinis alongside with Inglis tried to put pressure back on India. As boundaries came thick and fast, both quickly raised a 62-run stand but Shami came back and got rid of a dangerous-looking Stoinis for 29 in the 47th over. In the very next over, Jasprit Bumrah deceived Inglis and the Aussie keeper departed for a well-made run-a-ball 45.Shami fifer and Cummins cameoLooking to up the scoring rate, as Australia lost set Stoinis and Inglis, Shami then ran through the lower order with two quick wickets. Dismissing Matthew Short and Sean Abbott for 2 and 2 respectively, Shami registered his best ever figures of 5/51 in the format. With the fifer, Shami (37) also became the second most successful bowler after legendary Kapil Dev (45) against Australia in ODIs. With Australia staring at an all out situation, skipper Pat Cummins got in a few boundaries taking Australia to a competitive total. His 9-ball 21 cameo provided the finishing touches before the last man Adam Zampa got run out off the final ball of the innings.The perfect startChasing a competitive total, India's new opening pair of Shubman Gill and Ruturaj Gaikwad got off to a perfect start. In the form of his life, Gill began aggressively in the chase while Ruturaj, who will be leading the Indian team in the Asian Games, too made a confident start. As the duo got going, boundaries flew thick and fast for the hosts inside the first Powerplay. The duo added 66 runs in the first 10 overs, setting the tone for the chase. Taking on the Australian bowlers, both continued with their aggressive approach, helping India cross the 100-run park in the 16th over. In the process, Gill got to his 9th ODI fifty off just 37 balls, Ruturaj too followed him soon, raising his bat for the first time in ODIs -- a fifty off 61 balls. As the duo kept on going, Australians looked absolutely clueless. But then Adam Zampa provided the much-needed breakthrough, trapping Ruturaj with a slider in the 22nd over. By the time Ruturaj fell, India had 142 runs on the board.The wobbleWith the openers adding 142 runs at the top, the chase looked like a cakewalk for India. But the relentless Aussies, soon after Ruturaj fell, pounced onto the opportunity and struck multiple times in a very short span of time. One over after Ruturaj's dismissal, comeback man Shreyas Iyer (3) threw away his wicket, calling out for an impossible run. Set Shubman too made the long walk back for 74 an over after Iyer's dismissal as he missed a slider from Zampa. From 142 for 0, India were now 151 for 3 in the 26th over. With a partnership needed to steady the wobble, skipper KL Rahul and Ishan Kishan joined hands and moved forward cautiously. Ishan did try to hit occasional boundaries but Rahul was focussed more on rotating the strike. However, after a brief recovery, Cummins returned to remove Ishan for 28 in the 33rd over with India under 100 runs away from the target.Rahul, Surya take India homeWhen Ishan fell, India were still 92 runs away from target and the Australians had their tails up but experienced batters KL Rahul and Suryakumar Yadav understood the situation perfectly and just didn't take any risks. With the asking rate below 6 RPO, both focussed on rotation of strike along with putting away the occasional bad balls. With the two batters not taking any risks, they kept the Australian bowlers at bay. Wickets were the only solution for Australia to make a comeback but Rahul and Surya ensured there were no further hiccups. Under-pressure Surya, who was under the pump for his below-par batting performances in the ODIs, stepped up to the occasion, playing a mature knock. As the duo added 80 runs for the fifth wicket, Surya notched up his 3rd ODI fifty off 47 balls. But soon after his fifty, Surya played a rash shot and got out. But by the time Surya departed India were close to the finish line. Rahul ensured he took India home safely from there. Raising his 14th fifty, Rahul (58 not out) along with Ravindra Jadeja (3 not out) took India home with 8 balls to spare.\",\n",

       " \"Ginger, a versatile and aromatic spice, has been an integral part of global cuisine and traditional medicine for centuries. Whether used for its bold flavour, culinary prowess, or medicinal properties, ginger remains a cherished ingredient in various forms. There are two primary variations of ginger - dry and fresh which offer distinct attributes when it comes to usage, nutrition, and health benefits. Here is all you need to find out about these two varieties, that can help you make informed choices. Fresh gingerWhen it comes to fresh ginger, it is known for its pungency, peppery, and slightly sweet flavour, and is often used as a foundational ingredient in a myriad of dishes worldwide. Its versatile nature allows it to be used in both savoury and sweet preparations. When it comes to the culinary preparations, fresh ginger is mostly used for making a variety of stir-fries, curries, soups, and marinades. It infuses dishes with a distinctive aroma and taste. Not just dishes, but fresh ginger can also be used in the grated or sliced versions, as that can help boost the flavour of teas, smoothies, or lemonades for a zesty kick. This variety of ginger can alos be incorporated into baked goods for adding a warm and spicy note. Some of the popular desserts made with fresh ginger are Gingerbread Cookies, Ginger Halwa, Ginger Cake, Ginger Laddoo, etc. In several Asian countries, fresh ginger is also pickled and served as a palate-cleansing condiment. While in Japan, its known as Gari (enjoyed along with Wasabi and Sushi), in India it is simply known as Adrak Ka Achar. Dry gingerWhen it comes to the dried form of ginger, it is popularly known as “Saunth or Sonth” in Hindi and is often used in powder. It is essentially fresh ginger that has been dehydrated and ground into a fine powder. This process significantly alters its flavour and makes dry ginger a concentrated spice. Some of the common culinary applications of dry ginger are that it is used as a key ingredient in spice blends like curry powder, pumpkin pie spice, and garam masala, lending a warm and earthy flavour. From delicious gravies to Tandoori appetizers or even tea; Saunth can bring a lot of change into the everyday food. Dry ginger has a warm potency and this is why, it is often used in chilly weather or winter season. This spice is also added to certain dishes to bring a subtle heat that can help warm the body. Some of the popular dishes made with dry ginger are Saunth Ke Laddoo, Hareera/Harira, Saunth aur Gud ki Chutney, variety of cakes and cookies, etc.ALSO READ: Why Mughals loved Saunth and what makes it so special in Ayurveda Nutrition and health benefits of fresh and dry gingerWhen it comes to nutrition, fresh ginger boasts a range of health benefits attributed to its natural form and the presence of active compounds like gingerol. It helps in digestion while reducing nausea, bloating, and indigestion. Fresh ginger also has anti-inflammatory properties that may alleviate symptoms of arthritis and reduce muscle pain. It is rich in antioxidants and vitamin C, and can boost the immune system. It is commonly used to alleviate morning sickness during pregnancy. While the drying process can cause a slight loss in some nutrients, dry ginger retains many beneficial properties and it may help in providing relief from inflammatory conditions like osteoarthritis. Dry ginger's concentrated compounds can help combat infections and inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria. Some studies suggest that dry ginger may help lower blood sugar levels. Similar to fresh ginger, dry ginger can help alleviate nausea and motion sickness. While fresh and dry ginger each offer unique flavours and they have their unique applications in the culinary world, they differ a lot nutritionally. Both forms of ginger cater to a variety of needs and the choice between fresh and dry ginger depends on your culinary preferences and the specific dish you're preparing. Whether you prefer the bold and zesty profile of fresh ginger or the convenience and versatility of dry ginger powder, there's no denying that ginger, in any form, is a spice worth including in your daily repertoire for both its flavour and potential health perks.ALSO READ: Tender coconut water: Benefits and precautions you should knowUses of gingerFrom masala chai to curries, ginger is always used to enhance the taste and aroma of any dish across Indian cuisines. And as per experts, it not only enhances the taste but also improves the nutritional value of the dish. When added to masala chai, it helps relieve cough and sore throat. And when added to curry, it helps reduce the acidic value of key ingredients like legumes.Uses of dry gingerIt is often used in cooking items with a longer shelf life. From laddoos, pinnis to mathris, use of dry ginger in the form of powder gives the perfect taste and aroma without disturbing the shelf life of the food items. Also, in case you are running short of fresh ginger at home, you can use dry ginger as the perfect alternative. The powder can also be used for Ginger Baths. All you need to do is, mix 1 tablespoon of dry ginger powder and mix it with an equal amount of baking soda. Rub it gently on the body for cleaning and see the magic.\",\n",

The new promo unveils how Rohit Shetty makes Divyanka do some funny tasks with the contestants. In the promo, Rohit Shetty is seated in the camera van and he instructs Divyanka to do a few dares. The first one is that Divyanka had to scratch Arjit Taneja's hair and ruin his hairstyle. Divyanka quickly grabs Arjit's head and starts scratching it. Arjit is confused about why Divyanka is doing this to him and he keeps running away. The next target is Nyrraa, Rohit Shetty asks Divyanka to cut Nyrraa's hair. Divyanka first goes and stands behind Nyrraa and then removes a pair of scissors and grabs her hair. Nyrraa panics and starts screaming and trying to get hold of her hair back. But Divyanka succeeds in cutting one strand. Then the next dare leaves everyone dancing. Rohit Shetty asks Divyanka to do gidda standing next to Rashmeet. Even Rashmeet starts dancing and then Aishwarya and Archana also join them. All the contestants are baffled as to what happened to Divyanka suddenly.

       "'LUCKNOW: Two years after the Covid-19 pandemic, a whopping 3.3 lakh candidates from across the country registered for the Common Admission Test (CAT) 2023, thus breaking all records for admissions to the management programme of premier IIMs and other B-schools. The registrations stood at 2.5 lakh last year. The test is scheduled on November 26.According to CAT 2023 convener Prof Sanjeet Singh from IIM-Lucknow, the organising institute for the test this year, there is a record increase of 30% in the applications in one year. The rise was 11% in 2022.\"The registrations are highest in history of CAT, ever since it was started in 1977. In absolute numbers, an increase of 75,000 applications, year-on-year, is a record,\" Singh told TOI.Female registrations see a 3% increase in CAT this yearThe high numbers, said experts, reflect sustained interest students have in the field of management and in IIMs. \"I believe increased publicity about CAT on social media platforms and adding more test cities with increase in exam centres, particularly in tier-II cities, have resulted in this highest-ever registrations,\" said Prof Singh. Of the total 3.3 lakh, 1.17 lakh, or 38%, are female. There has been a 3% increase in female registrations. Over the past decade, IIMs have taken multiple steps to increase gender diversity in management education. Consequently, IIMs have anywhere between 30% and 45% female students on their campuses. Till 2008, CAT was a pen and-paper test. This year, 2.9 lakh applicants had registered, which was the previous highest number of registernations. \"The first computer-based test was held in 2009,\" said Prof Singh. After this, the numbers dipped and rose gradually. While 2.41 lakh registered themselves in 2019, the number dipped in 2020 to 2.28, when the first wave of Covid-19 hit the world- .CAT 2023 will be a computer-based test of 120 minutes. The test will have the following three sections: Section I: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Section II: Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning, Section III: Quantitative Ability. Candidates will be allotted 40 minutes for answering questions in each section and they will not be allowed to switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section. Tutorials to understand the format of the test will be available on the CAT website. Candidates are advised to work on the tutorials available on the CAT website well in advance.'"

       "'LUCKNOW: Two years after the Covid-19 pandemic, a whopping 3.3 lakh candidates from across the country registered for the Common Admission Test (CAT) 2023, thus breaking all records for admissions to the management programme of premier IIMs and other B-schools. The registrations stood at 2.5 lakh last year. The test is scheduled on November 26.According to CAT 2023 convener Prof Sanjeet Singh from IIM-Lucknow, the organising institute for the test this year, there is a record increase of 30% in the applications in one year. The rise was 11% in 2022.\"The registrations are highest in history of CAT, ever since it was started in 1977. In absolute numbers, an increase of 75,000 applications, year-on-year, is a record,\" Singh told TOI.Female registrations see a 3% increase in CAT this yearThe high numbers, said experts, reflect sustained interest students have in the field of management and in IIMs. \"I believe increased publicity about CAT on social media platforms and adding more test cities with increase in exam centres, particularly in tier-II cities, have resulted in this highest-ever registrations,\" said Prof Singh. Of the total 3.3 lakh, 1.17 lakh, or 38%, are female. There has been a 3% increase in female registrations. Over the past decade, IIMs have taken multiple steps to increase gender diversity in management education. Consequently, IIMs have anywhere between 30% and 45% female students on their campuses. Till 2008, CAT was a pen and-paper test. This year, 2.9 lakh applicants had registered, which was the previous highest number of registernations. \"The first computer-based test was held in 2009,\" said Prof Singh. After this, the numbers dipped and rose gradually. While 2.41 lakh registered themselves in 2019, the number dipped in 2020 to 2.28, when the first wave of Covid-19 hit the world- .CAT 2023 will be a computer-based test of 120 minutes. The test will have the following three sections: Section I: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Section II: Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning, Section III: Quantitative Ability. Candidates will be allotted 40 minutes for answering questions in each section and they will not be allowed to switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section. Tutorials to understand the format of the test will be available on the CAT website. Candidates are advised to work on the tutorials available on the CAT website well in advance.'"

       "'BENGALURU: India’s move to suspend visa services to Canadian citizens amid a diplomatic row is likely to have triggered concerns among technology companies, professionals and entrepreneurs.While potential new contracts could get delayed, the impact on projects that Indian IT companies are already implementing there may be limited, since Canada has not halted visa applications by Indians to Canada.If Canada were to also stop visa applications, the implications could be more significant. On the whole though, considering the world learnt to work without travel during the Covid pandemic, visa restrictions are unlikely to severely handicap business in the short term.Vikram Shroff, head of HR Law at Nishith Desai Associates, said the Indian government’s decision implies that investors, entrepreneurs, and techies who are Canadian citizens may not be able to get visas to travel to India. \"Technology talent mobility would be adversely affected between the two countries,” he said. Shroff said the decision does not affect those Canadian citizens who have an existing Indian visa or OCI card. “It also does not affect Indian citizens to continue to travel to Canada including for family, business, or education purposes,” he noted.More than 600 Canadian companies have a presence in India and over 1,000 Canadian companies are pursuing business interests in India. Indian IT companies have a sizable exposure to outsourcing work from Canadian companies. Earlier, this year, Montreal-based Bombardier roped in TCS to modernise the former’s legacy systems that support its engineering, manufacturing, aftermarket services and defence activities. Last year, TCS became the new title sponsor of the TCS Toronto Waterfront Marathon that includes developing a race app in partnership with Canada Running Series (CRS) to provide an integrated digital experience. Infosys has committed to hire 8,000 Canadians by 2024 and it’s well past the halfway mark. Wipro has a big contractual relationship with Canadian energy utilities company Atco to provide outsourcing solutions.Indian IT firms have centres in Mississauga, Ontario, Montreal, Quebec, and Waterloo, all of which are premier tech talent hotspots. Canadian fund houses have invested in India\\'s startup ecosystem. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), for instance, has invested at least Rs 1.7 lakh crore in India. It has investments in companies including Nykaa, Acko, Byju\\'s and Zomato. Canadian fund Ontario Teachers has invested more than $3 billion in India.Cyrus D Mehta, managing partner of New York-based law firm Cyrus D Mehta Partners, said, “Although India has suspended visas for Canadians, it would not be wise for Canada to block visas for Indian nationals. While countries can engage in tit for tat retaliation with diplomats, it should not extend such tit for tat to visa policy. Keeping the immigration channels open helps to diffuse tensions and improve understanding among the people of both countries.”India’s apex tech body Nasscom said it is in close touch with its members in Canada and as per their feedback there are no immediate areas of concern. \"Since this is an evolving situation, we will continue to engage with stakeholders to track any potential areas of impact that may need support,” it said.'"
