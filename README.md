# TIL Project


Welcome! This repository is dedicated to a TIL project i.e. text classification project where we aim to build a robust and accurate text/article classification model according to IAB Categories.

## Project Overview

Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves categorizing text into predefined classes or categories. It has a wide range of applications, including sentiment analysis, spam detection, topic categorization, and more.

In this project, we'll be developing a text classification model using deep learning techniques and Foundation Models(LLMs) like Llama2 by Meta, MistralAI, etc.. The goal is to accurately classify text data/articles into different classes based on IAB categorization.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is prepared by combining different datasets and Scraping different articles from different sources like TOI, Economic Times, etc. It consists of a diverse collection of articles and texts labeled with their respective 26 categories. The dataset is well-preprocessed and ready for use in training and evaluating our text classification model.
